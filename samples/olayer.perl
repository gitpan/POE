# This is a simple Object Layer functionality test.  It contains a
# simple "soft" object repository that works like the sessions.perl
# example.

# This code is experimental.  Everything in the Object Layer is
# subject to change, with no backward compatibility guarantees.

# Notes on some of the hidden things:
#
# $object->post() fires an event at an object within the same session.
# $object->spawn() fires an event at an object in a new session.
#
# The "Object Layer" is reusing the session parameter constants, but
# some of the meanings have changed.  Here are the parameters and how
# I'm currently using them:
#
# ME = A reference to the current object.  This is an alias for
# POE::Session::OBJECT.
#
# SESSION = undef.  Objects should not have to worry about sessions.
# KERNEL  = undef.  Objects should not have to deal with the Kernel.
#
#   SESSION and KERNEL will be supplied to objects owned by "root"
#   type users.  This should allow secure, controlled access to the
#   low-level POE functions.
#
# HEAP   = The current session's heap.  This is runtime environment.
#
# METHOD = The name of the object method being run.  Pointless?
# ACTOR  = A reference to the object that invoked this one.
# ARG0..ARG9 = Parameters passed to post() or spawn().

# Object attributes that are used by the object layer:
#
# session_leader
#
#   Not currently used.  session_leader causes post() to behave
#   differently.  If the object containing session_leader has been
#   spawned in its own session, then any events posted to it will run
#   in the controlling session-- NOT THE POSTER'S SESSION!
#
#   Spawning objects with a boolean false session_leader is undefined.
#
#   Posting events to a session_leader that has no controlling session
#   is undefined.
#
# parent
#
#   Used to find attributes in objects' ancestors.

# TO DO:
#
# Exception model.  It should be neat, tidy, and contain an enormous
# amount of syntactic sugar to hide what surely will be lots of gross
# guts.
#
# Map Object.pm into an "object" object, so that most of the object
# model may be coded from within itself. :)
