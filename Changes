Revision history for Perl extension POE.

0.01  1998.08.15

  - Initial release.  Implemented Kernel, Session, Wheel, Driver,
  Filter.

0.02  1998.11.22

  - Rewrote signals.  Signals now propagate from parent to child
  sessions.  "Terminal" signals now only kill sessions that don't
  otherwise handle them.

  - Allowed subsecond resolution in Kernel.pm if Time::HiRes is
  available.  See the docs for POE::Kernel::alarm().

  - Added POE::Kernel::delay() for "time() + $seconds" alarms.  Uses
  Kernel's time(), which may be from Time::HiRes.

  - Parent sessions will now wait around until all child sessions
  finish, unless they're explicitly killed off.

  - Fixed a blessing bleed that caused implicitly returned objects to
  die in the wrong scope (confounding resource management).

  - Added tests/proxy.perl, a simple line-based proxy example.
