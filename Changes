Revision history for Perl extension POE.

*** 0.031 1998.11.24

- Added tests/objsessions.perl to the manifest.  D'oh!


*** 0.03  1998.11.23

- Added new constructor syntax to POE::Session.  It's now possible to
say: new POE::Session($kernel, $object, \@methods).  See
tests/objsession.perl for an example.

- Removed an unnecessary function call in Kernel.pm.

- Rearranged Changes so the most recent ones come first.


*** 0.02  1998.11.22

- Rewrote signals.  Signals now propagate from parent to child
sessions.  "Terminal" signals now only kill sessions that don't
otherwise handle them.

- Allowed subsecond resolution in Kernel.pm if Time::HiRes is
available.  See the docs for POE::Kernel::alarm().

- Added POE::Kernel::delay() for "time() + $seconds" alarms.  Uses
Kernel's time(), which may be from Time::HiRes.

- Parent sessions will now wait around until all child sessions
finish, unless they're explicitly killed off.

- Fixed a blessing bleed that caused implicitly returned objects to
die in the wrong scope (confounding resource management).

- Added tests/proxy.perl, a simple line-based proxy example.


*** 0.01  1998.08.15

- Initial release.  Implemented Kernel, Session, Wheel, Driver,
Filter.
