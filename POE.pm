=head1 NAME

POE - the Perl Operating Environment

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use POE;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In general, POE provides "kernel" services, including C<select(2)>, events
signals, alarms and reusable boilerplates for common functions.

In specific, POE uses C<POE::Kernel> and C<POE::Session> for you.

=head1 CLASSES

=over 4

=item * POE::Kernel - main loop; select(2), signal, alarm, event services

=item * POE::Session - state machine managed by C<POE::Kernel>

=item * POE::Driver (abstract) - drive (read and write) an C<IO::Handle>

=item * POE::Driver::SysRW - C<sysread> and C<syswrite> on an C<IO::Handle>

=item * POE::Filter (abstract) - bidirectional stream cooker; converts raw
data to something useful (such as lines), and back

=item * POE::Filter::Line - break input into lines; add newlines to output

=item * POE::Wheel (abstract) - a way to extend C<POE::Session> by adding or
removing event handlers from state machines

=item * POE::Wheel::ReadWrite - manage read/write states for a session

=item * POE::Wheel::ListenAccept - accept incoming TCP socket connections

=item * POE::Wheel::FollowTail - watch the end of an ever-growing file

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over

=item * F<tests/followtail.perl>

Starts 21 sessions, and runs them until SIGINT.  10 sessions write to dummy
log files; 10 sessions follow the log tails; one session spins its wheels to
make sure things are not blocking.

=item * F<tests/forkbomb.perl>

Starts one session whose job is to continually start copies of itself (and
occasionally quit).  A counter limits this test to about 150 total sessions,
and the kernel will respond to SIGINT by killing everything and exiting.

This is an excellent shakedown of parent/child relationships and signals.

=item * F<tests/objsessions.perl>

This is a version of F<tests/sessions.perl> (see below) that uses a
blessed object's methods as event handlers.  Thanks to sky_GOD for the
idea and original code.

=item * F<tests/proxy.perl>

This is a simple line-based TCP proxy.  It redirects connections from
localhost:7777 to perl.com:echo.  It shows how to use two or more wheels
from a single session.

=item * F<tests/selects.perl>

Starts two sessions, and runs until SIGINT.  The first session is a TCP chargen
server; the second is a simple TCP client that connects to the first.  The
client session has a limiter that causes the session to exit after printing a
few chargen lines.

C<POE::Wheel::ReadWrite> and C<POE::Wheel::ListenAccept> were based on the code
here.

This was the second test, written to exercise the C<select(2)> logic in
C<POE::Kernel>.

=item * F<tests/sessions.perl>

Starts five sessions that loop a few times and stop.  It was written to
exercise the C<POE::Kernel> event queue.

=item * F<tests/signals.perl>

One session that prints out a dot every second and recognizes SIGINT.

=item * F<tests/curator.perl>

Lame attempt to exercise C<POE::Curator>.
