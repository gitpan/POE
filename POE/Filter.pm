POE::Filter - convert between raw and cooked streams

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Derivatives of C<POE::Filter> provide standard IO cooking and
uncooking for their parent C<IO::Session>s.  For example,
C<POE::Filter::Line> breaks up input into newline-delimited chunks of
input, and it appends newlines to the ends of chunks being output.
