The bulk of this README's information has migrated to the POE manpage.

------------------------------
Compatibility Between Versions
------------------------------

As POE moves closer towards the Common Sense axis, it sometimes
diverges away from the Backwards Compatible axis.  If this version is
being installed over a previous one, please check the Changes file to
see what it might break.  Interface changes usually are documented.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

POE may be installed through the CPAN shell in the usual CPAN shell
manner.  It typically is:

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install POE'

It involves a little more work if you have an older CPAN shell:

  perl -MCPAN -e shell
  install POE

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

POE can also be installed manually.  The latest CPAN version can be
found at <ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/R/RC/RCAPUTO/> or in
a similarl named directory at your favorite CPAN mirror.  The most
recent development snapshot, which only rarely contains heinous
showstopper bugs, is available from the author's web site at
<http://www.newts.org/~troc/poe.html>.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as an exercise for
the reader.  To "build" and test it afterwards:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

The POE manpage discusses system requirements and compatibility
issues.  You can preview it with:

  perldoc ./POE.pm

There are several sample programs in the samples subdirectory.  The
POE manpage briefly explains them.

  ls -l samples

Finally you can install it:

  make install

-------------------------
Test Results and Coverage
-------------------------

These are the results for `make test` in POE 0.11, on an old 486
running FreeBSD 4.0-STABLE with perl 5.6.0, Event 0.79, and Perl/Tk
800.021:

All tests successful.
Files=18, Tests=294, 721 wallclock secs (245.87 cusr + 21.68 csys = 267.55 CPU)

POE's development after 0.1005 includes a big push to test everything.
To further this effort, POE now includes some extra profiling code
which isn't installed.  Anyway, here's a list of POE's modules and
approximate coverage statistics for each.  These numbers are misleading
at best, but they give a rough idea of what's been tested.

Good luck, and thank you for reading!
