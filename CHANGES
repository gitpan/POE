    Updated Chris Williams' fine POD tests to more explicitly treat
    certain methods as private. Also added a "strict" mode that doesn't
    skip over the methods temporarily considered private while we figure
    out whether they should really be so. Also removed tabs while I was
    in there. Curse you, tabs!
    
    Removed new() methods from classes that are really uninstantiated
    mixins. Calling a nonexistent method is semantically about the same
    as calling a constructor that only exists to croak. Had to remove
    tests for the croaks as well.
    
    Documented select_pause_read() and select_resume_read().
    
    Added leading underscores to a bunch of helper functions and methods
    that should really have been private. There are more to come, but
    their privacy status is less obvious. 

  2006-09-08 02:56:42 (r2115) by rcaputo; poe/Makefile.PL M

    Turn off executable bit. Apparently executable Makefile.PLs are bad. 

  2006-09-08 02:54:35 (r2114) by rcaputo; poe/examples/queue.perl M

    Make this file executable. 

  2006-09-08 02:51:51 (r2113) by rcaputo; poe/examples A; poe/samples D

    Rename samples to examples. 

  2006-09-08 02:51:03 (r2112) by rcaputo; poe/MANIFEST M

    Rename the samples files to examples files. 

  2006-09-07 22:13:39 (r2111) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm M

    Remove the disclaimer about needing system's tail for robustness.
    It's only an issue if log files are rotated incorrectly, and in that
    case even the system's tail will fail.

  poe/lib/POE/Component/Client/TCP.pm M

    Pedro Melo suggested on the mailing list that clearing the components
    alias be delayed until after the disconnect callback. This revision
    applies his patch. 

  2006-09-06 15:34:03 (r2109) by rcaputo

    Start testing different editor commands. 

  2006-09-05 05:47:42 (r2103) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M

    POE::Wheel::Readline would delete twice as many characters as
    necessary on a kill-word command.

  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_curses.pm M

    Put the intrflush() call back, and skip all my shiny new tests
    because some Curses functions block terribly under unbuffered ptys.
    But they only do the blocking on some platforms. Grrrr. 

  2006-09-05 02:48:00 (r2101) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_curses.pm M

    Make this into a proper test. Keystrokes are pushed down to a
    Wheel::Curses running under a pseudo tty. 

  2006-09-05 02:46:27 (r2100) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Curses.pm M

    Comment out the intrflush() call. It flushes to the terminal, which
    may be a bad thing if it's an unbuffered pipe. 

  2006-09-05 01:42:03 (r2099) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_readline.pm M

    Create proper data-driven tests for Wheel::ReadLine. You can tweak
    various bits of Wheel::ReadLine by adding new test data to the start
    of this program. 

  2006-09-05 01:41:11 (r2098) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M

    A cheezy hack to avoid destroying Wheel::ReadLine instances from
    within POE::Kernel's space. A proper fix would be to somehow break
    this wheel's circular references to $self so that DESTROY is
    triggered immediately when the user destroys the objects' last
    references. 

  2006-09-04 21:17:47 (r2097) by rcaputo

  2006-09-04 20:08:31 (r2094) by lotr; poe/lib/POE/Session.pm M

    Edited the docs for new() to reflect the deprecation status 

  2006-09-03 14:43:44 (r2093) by bingosnet; extras/smoker.perl M

    Switched smoker.perl to LWP::UserAgent. This way it'll work on
    MSWin32 too.

  2006-09-03 06:23:35 (r2092) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm M

    POE::Loop::Gtk doesn't perform I/O callbacks in exactly the same
    order as the other event loop bridges. Compensate by increasing the
    expected fetch count here. I'm not sure how we'll be able to
    guarantee I/O callback order, so it isn't at this time. 

  2006-09-02 14:25:09 (r2091) by bingosnet; extras/smoker.perl M

    Updated smoker.perl. Made decent defaults for cmd line arguments and
    added POD.

  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_readline.pm M

    Can't test Wheel::ReadLine without Term::ReadKey. Sorry... that's
    just the way it goes. 

  2006-09-02 05:53:27 (r2089) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/IO_Poll.pm M

    IO::Poll I/O callbacks were in a slightly different order than
    select() ones, at least on Cygwin. How did I know? Because one of
    Benjamin Smith's tests behaved differently (failed, that is) on
    Cygwin. Anyway, the ordering has been fixed, and the test should pass
    now.

  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm M

    Resolve rt.cpan.org ticket 20990. XS modules define stub functions
    that throw errors when the underlying C constant is not available.
    Merely checking for defined(\&CONSTANT) is not good enough because it
    will always be true. One must eval { my $x = &CONSTANT } to see
    whether using the constant is legal. That's what the new code does
    here. Thanks to Eric Rybski for pointing out the problem.

    Skip Wheel::ReadLine tests in ActivePerl. ActivePerl can't multiplex
    terminal/console filehandles. 

  2006-09-01 04:04:14 (r2085) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Explain that read error 0 happens when the child closes one of its
    standard output handles. Also explain that "$!" eq "" when $! == 0 in
    Perl. Resolves rt.cpan.org ticket 19054.

  poe/lib/POE/Loop/TkCommon.pm M

    Fix a Tk busy loop, reported by Michael Hartmann in rt.cpan.org
    ticket 20978. If POE's only using timers, POE::Loop::TkCommon's main
    loop was spinning at 100% cpu. Now it's not, although it meant
    significant changes through some of the event loops. Gtk remains
    untested, too. 

  2006-09-01 02:48:35 (r2083) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm M

    Increase the child process timeout. It timed out accidentially when
    my machine was overloaded. 

  2006-09-01 01:09:10 (r2082) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M

    POE::Wheel::ReadLine isn't supported on Windows. ActivePerl can only
    multiplex sockets.

  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/k_signals_rerun.pm M

    It really seems that Event doesn't catch SIGCHLD, or at least not
    while restarting the event loop. These tests are skipped for now,
    when there's a combination of Event and MSWin32. 

  2006-08-31 07:18:17 (r2080) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/90_regression/broeren-win32-nbio.t M

    Clear the SIGCHLD handler when we're done, otherwise the test never
    exits. 

  2006-08-31 04:52:58 (r2079) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/k_signals_rerun.pm M

    Skip the signals rerun test when using a combination of Event.pm and
    MSWin32. Apparently Event can't catch SIGCHLD in Windows. A better
    solution would be to poll for SIGCHLD in this case, but it's a tricky
    exception to make.

  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M; poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm M

    Disallow users calling put() on a POE::Wheel::Run instance that has
    already had its STDIN handle closed. 

  2006-08-28 19:09:00 (r2077) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm M

    Switch from exit() to CORE::exit() for testing under Tk. Have the
    test child program exit one of two ways: "got eof" if it truly has
    exited its while(<STDIN>) loop for EOF reasons, or "got alarm" if the
    child process timed out. Also increased the timeout for slow or
    bogged down machines. Unfortunately the @shutdown_expected test times
    out rather than receives "got eof", so now the test is broken. And
    furthermore, it tries to put() after calling shutdown_stdin() which
    seems wrong. Anyway, this test is still broken. 

  2006-08-28 04:47:23 (r2076) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Session.pm M

    _default no longer needs to worry about its return value if it's
    handling a signal. Either it calls sig_handled() or it doesn't. 

  2006-08-26 16:16:27 (r2075) by bsmith
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm M

    Skip tests that fail on win32.

  2006-08-24 13:47:37 (r2074) by bingosnet
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_readline.pm M

    Made wheel_readline tests skip all on MSWin32 when standard input is
    not a terminal.

  2006-08-23 07:25:27 (r2073) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/k_signals_rerun.pm M

    Tests were failing under Tk because Tk traps exit() and throws a
    strange error when it's called. Changed Wheel::Run to an arrayref
    form of Program, which spawns an extra process but allows the process
    to call its own darned exit(). 

  2006-08-23 06:23:51 (r2072) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm M

    Program => "string" may be double forking when run on some platforms,
    in some shells, or both. I'm not sure exactly. Replace it with
    Program => [ "stuff", "here" ] to avoid executing the command line
    through a shell. Thanks to Charles Ayres for reporting this and
    letting me use his machine for testing. 

  2006-08-22 06:16:35 (r2071) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_readwrite.pm M

    Disable a large chunk of tests under Tk because seek() fails. Tk
    doesn't support seek() in its Tk::IO handles.

    My extensions to the POE::Session tests accidentally reverted the

    Add a test case (and fix) for a session garbage collection timing

    documentation

  2006-08-20 06:42:30 (r2056) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/Event.pm M

    Replace POE::Loop::Event's direct use of Event's main loop with a
    very small custom one. Also remove use of $Event::DIED. The
    combination of these changes allows Yuval Kogman's new test program
    to pass and minimizes the amount of extraneous noise generated by
    Event's own exception handling.

    Save unhandled exceptions so they'll be rethrown from a safe place.
    _dispatch_event() is too deep in the call stack to successfully
    rethrow a die(). 

  2006-08-20 06:34:51 (r2053) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Events.pm M

    After dispatching a timeslice, check whether an unhandled exception
    occurred. If so, clean up the kernel and rethrow the exception from a
    safe place. 

  2006-08-20 06:33:46 (r2052) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/90_regression/rt19908-merlyn-stop.t M

    Improve the test by counting _stop invocations and making sure that
    POE::Kernel->run() exits due to the exception in _stop. Removed some
    DOSish carriage returns. 

  2006-08-19 22:30:34 (r2051) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Re-instate exception handling from _stop, since we need it or
    otherwise POE::Kernel is left in a corrupt state.
    
    Also make signals (except IDLE and ZOMBIE) properly keep sessions
    alive. Previously they only did it sort of half-heartedly, and there
    were cases where sessions could go away despite handling signals.
    
    The IDLE and ZOMBIE signals don't keep sessions alive. Otherwise
    merely watching for them would ensure that they never occurred.

    Don't allow _data_ses_stop() to stop a session currently being
    stopped. This is needed for proper exception handling in _stop
    handlers, otherwise infinite recursion happens. That's bad.

    Yuval Kogman discovered two problems in exception throwing for die()
    during _stop: Exceptions as overloaded objects would sometimes fail
    to be detected because they stringify to "". Exceptions during _stop
    would be handled by eval{} and never rethrown.

    Apply Nick Williams's patch to only enable raw input when
    POE::Wheel::ReadLine is expecting input. Ctrl+C, for example, will
    still thrown a SIGINT while a program is not waiting on a pending
    get(). I'm not sure this is great, but it's worth a try. 

  2006-08-09 03:40:41 (r2038) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M

    If Wheel::ReadLine must die because it cannot open a private copy of

    The resources test which looks for XS modules being preferentially
    loaded was assuming that the names passed to CORE::GLOBAL::require
    hooks were formatted as path names, but 5.6.[12] (at least) passes

    Make the MSWin32 non-blocking ioctl() call a little more informative.
    Most WinSock error codes are well beyond the normal $! range, so the
    stringy $! always comes back "Unknown error". At least now you also
    get the nummy version, like 10038, which lets you look up the real
    error ("NOT A SOCKET!!").
    
    Also fix a test on MSWin32. It was failing because the handle being
    selected was... NOT A SOCKET!!

    The previous leak fix broke some tests. Shaaaaame! This fixes the
    test breakage by going ahead with the delete $INC{$path} but only if
    the serializer package does not have the methods we need. Upshot? The

    Stop deleting the freezer module's path from from %INC. While this
    does prompt Perl to fully reload the module, it also introduces a bad
    memory leak when POE::Filter::Reference->new() is called with a
    package name. Given the choice between both bad outcomes, I'll prefer
    the noisy one to the silent but deadly one. This resolvels

    Use POSIX::_exit(0) for the event loop tests when they're run in

  2006-05-30 19:10:28 (r1969) by bsmith; poe/mylib/gen-tests.perl M

    Modified gen-tests to use CORE::exit instead of POSIX::_exit, and to
    use Test::More in the outer script as this sets up handy things like
    autoflush.

  2006-05-30 18:55:43 (r1968) by bsmith; poe/mylib/coverage.perl M

    Added some commandline flags to coverage.perl to allow it to run
    prove(1) instead of make test, not clean & build before running the
    tests, and to just print out the -MDevel::Cover option that should be
    used.

  2006-05-27 11:37:08 (r1967) by bsmith; poe/mylib/coverage.perl M

    Changes to mylib/coverage.perl:

    Fixes for running individual tests, and hiding modules in tests/.

    Whenever you work with relative time, you have to measure "now"
    absolutely as soon as possible. Moved the time() call from when
    delay_set sets the actual alarm to the very top, which is much closer
    to where the caller meant "now" to mean.

    Chris Fedde found a bug in the way Server::TCP creates filters. He
    was kind enough to provide a test case, so I was able to find and fix
    the problem easily. Thank you! 

  2006-04-10 20:37:40 (r1933) by rcaputo; poe/Makefile.PL M

    Fix a bug Rob Bloodgood discovered when installing on 5.5-ish
    systems. The find() subroutines were using next rather than return. 

  2006-04-06 17:58:43 (r1932) by rcaputo; poe/mylib/gen-meta.perl M

    Add the tests directory to the no-index directive. This should stop
    the CPAN indexer's squealing about missing permissions. 

  2006-04-06 16:21:11 (r1931) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

  2006-04-05 21:30:12 (r1926) by adamkennedy; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Moving a variable inside a scope to save an instruction per event

  2006-04-05 15:05:45 (r1925) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_tail.pm M

    Slow machines weren't seeing all the flushes. Turns out that the
    driver had a chance to glom together put() calls before the next
    writable event came around. Increased the delay between put() calls
    by an order of magnitude to avoid false test failures. 

  2006-04-05 04:22:47 (r1924) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/TkCommon.pm M

    Clear the we're-do-one-looping flag when a UIDESTROY signal is
    dispatched due to closing the main window. Otherwise the after()
    event tied to that window never fires (because the window is closed,
    duh), and an application can hang. 

  2006-04-05 04:21:26 (r1923) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_tail.pm M

    Explain a test result. Sometimes this test fails. It's not
    deterministic, but at least we'll know more about it the next time.

  poe/lib/POE/Component/Client/TCP.pm M;
  poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Matt Sickler patched POE::Component::Client::TCP and the server to
    use POE::Filter::* clone() methods if you pass an object rather than
    a class name to the Filter* parameters. 

  2006-04-02 12:25:53 (r1921) by adamkennedy; poe/lib/POE/Filter/Map.pm M

    Make the POE::Filter::Map synopsis a little more readable

    Matt Sickler added clone() methods to POE::Filter and its subclasses.
    This addresses a large part of rt.cpan.org #4931. 

  2006-04-02 00:33:21 (r1919) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M

    Use the emacs input mode by default. Everybody expects the arrow keys
    to work, and vi power users probably know about .inputrc already.
    
    Get the delete key doing that backward-character-delete thang. 

  2006-04-01 07:37:06 (r1918) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M

    rt.cpan.org squashes indents in source code and patches, and some
    code made it into this module without indents. Fixed that.
    
    More importantly, document the EDITOR=vi gotcha. If you don't have an
    .inputrc, POE::Wheel::ReadLine checks out your EDITOR environment
    variable for clues as to the mode it uses. As a result, many people
    will get vi editing mode without expecting it. 

  2006-03-29 07:05:40 (r1917) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_tail.pm M

    Change the test timing to work around Virtual PC's inconsistent
    emulated CPU clock. 

  2006-03-29 04:41:20 (r1916) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Chris Fedde discovered that the "harmless" practice of closing STDIN,
    STDOUT, and STDERR before dup'ing them seems to cause a problem on
    Unix-based systems when the parent process doesn't have stdio handles
    of its own. This commit resolves his rt.cpan.org ticket, #16691. 

  2006-03-29 04:22:22 (r1915) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Chris Fedde, in rt.cpan.org ticket #16691, accidentally discovered a
    case where closing STDOUT and STDERR together, then opening them for
    redirection, was breaking STDIN in child processes. This fixes the
    case, but it does not close his original ticket. I'm committing this
    separately so I can check it out in Windows to make sure I didn't
    just break things there.

    Eliminate a memory leak using Tk with ActiveState Perl. Resolves Ake

    Get the regression tester finding and downloading POE component
    tarballs again. CPANPLUS::Backend and ::Config have changed a little
    in the time since I last used this. 

  2006-03-28 05:22:55 (r1912) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Session.pm M

    Upgrade carp() to croak() in the new() constructor. This constructor
    has been deprecated since at least Nov 2004, so I think people have

  2006-03-28 04:31:29 (r1908) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M

    Applied Jeff Pinyan's patch to fix tab completion when the only match
    for a prefix is the full string of the match. Prior to the patch,
    Wheel::ReadLine would just ring the terminal bell and not display any
    matches.

    soon.

    Whitespace fix... I think. I can't actually see a difference when I
    diff the file.

    Remove POE::Preprocessor. Replaced it with a simple, almost one-liner
    preprocessor that's run at Makefile.PL time.

    Replace {% use_bytes %} with a Makefile.PL-time source filter, and
    cross my fingers. If this works out, it'll eliminate the last use of

    Bump up the version and throw in an underscore. Some people like to
    upload CPAN test reports on the cvs version, and it confuses things
    when the results are glommed under the last CPAN release.

    Remove ExtUtils::AutoInstall from the installer to support
    ActiveState's PPD builder. ActiveState's builder is still trivially
    broken months (years?) after I reported that ExtUtils::AutoInstall
    needs a configured CPAN.pm. So I give up.
    
    The questionnaire is replaced by a simple list of missing or outdated
    dependancies. ExtUtils::MakeMaker will still enforce our few hard
    requirements.

    The end-of-run child process reaper should block if there are
    unreaped processes out there. I mistakenly made the loop
    non-blocking, and now it's fixed.

    Add the ability to skip certain classes of tests on certain
    platforms, then use it to skip the IO::Poll tests on MSWin32. First,
    IO::Poll is kinda broken on MSWin32 and falls back to select()
    anyway. Second, some of the tests break outright in the IO::Poll
    fallback tests.

    Use the WNOHANG constant rather than the magic 0. Skip child reaping
    on Win32. It seems to cause problems of the "segfault" variety.

  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/comp_tcp_concurrent.pm M

    These tests fail under Win32, so I'm skipping them. It seems that
    Win32 socket creation isn't as concurrent as we'd expect, and
    deadlocks occur. 

  2005-12-18 22:45:18 (r1870) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Whitespace cleanup.

    Replace string evals with typeglob tricks to define various

    This patch fixes the recursive signal testing added earlier. It uses
    package globals instead of lexicals for the bookkeeping vars in
    POE/Resource/Signals.pm, this should be examined for a faster way if
    possible.
    
    All tests pass Linux Debian x86

  2005-12-10 06:25:58 (r1863) by hachi
  poe/tests/90_regression/steinert-recursive-signal.t A

    Welcome to recursive signals, this test makes sure that the
    sig_handled() flag does not affect outer signals during recursive
    dispatch.
    
    This is currently only occuring when a signal handler causes an
    exception, and the DIE signal is called in response to this. This
    test fails on cvspoe currently, patch forthcoming to fix it. 

  2005-12-09 06:12:44 (r1862) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    This release is different enough to warrant version 0.33 even though
    we haven't made our stated goals for this release. I'll probably
    break up the milestones in rt.cpan.org and stop trying to adhere to
    specific goals for specific versions.

  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    roll exception handling (ala POE::Exceptions) into the core. this
    patch creates a new terminal signal called DIE. if an exception
    occurs, this signal is sent to the session that caused the exception.
    by the nature of signals, if the child fails to handle the excpetion,
    the signal propogates up the session tree until either someone
    handles the signal or the poe environment collapses. two small tweaks
    were necessary outside of _dispatch_event. session_alloc needed to
    cache the value of _data_alias_loggable, for later logging, and it
    needed to check to see if the new session survived _start and _child
    dispatches. currently this new functionality is undocumented and does
    not have its own unit tests. this oversight will be corrected soon.
    right now, all current tests pass without modification on gentoo
    linux running kernel version 2.6.14 and perl 5.8.7.

    MSIE bites early and often. In this case, it's sending "\x0D\x0A"
    after Content-Length octets of POST request, which is clearly in
    violation of w3.org statute number mumble. Here we see the intrepid
    Philip Gwyn patch Filter::HTTPD to ignore whitespace after a full
    request. 

  2005-11-21 06:50:35 (r1854) by hachi; poe/lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm M

    Mandatory warning for reaped processes to pair with sigchld semantics
    changing. This loop will block the Kernel shutdown until all
    processes are reaped. All tests pass.

  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Resource/Sessions.pm M

    Change signal watchers so they keep sessions alive.
    
    WARNING: This is a major semantics change in POE. It has the
    potential to make code 'hang' in places where it formerly did not.
    
    This change is necessary so sessions expressing an interest in SIG
    CH?LD do not die prematurely. (There is a planned mandatory warning
    for reaped children that were not being watched.) This change fixes
    RT 15215. 

  2005-11-07 06:49:31 (r1851) by hachi; poe/lib/POE/Loop/PerlSignals.pm M

    Disable use of $SIG{CH?LD} = "IGNORE". This cannot be done in perl
    without breaking system() and friends. This fixes a failing
    tests/90_regression/merijn-sigchld-system.t

    loop if sessions == 0 

  2005-10-22 08:34:44 (r1849) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Resolved a conflict between two event types. The recursive signal
    type shared a value with a statistics gathering event type. Now they
    don't overlap. 

  2005-10-19 18:27:18 (r1848) by hachi
  poe/tests/90_regression/rt1648-tied-stderr.t M

    We need to watch for the child process ending in this test so we are
    a good example for the rest of people, and to avoid a mandatory
    warning that may be added in a near-future revision of POE. 

  2005-10-14 17:47:27 (r1847) by rcaputo; poe/MANIFEST.SKIP M

    Toy around with the idea of auto-generating MANIFEST at distribution
    time. I'm not satisfied with the opt-out nature of MANIFEST.SKIP.
    It's too easy to create a temporary file and forget to add it to the
    skip file. Next thing I know, crap's being distributed in the
    tarball. Possibly proprietary crap. I can't have that. 

  2005-10-14 17:26:19 (r1846) by rcaputo; poe/MANIFEST M

    SIGCHLD bug reported by Merijn Broeren on October 13 2005 on the
    mailing list. This test evokes the proper results for me (failure on
    new POE, success on old POE) on Linux 2.6, should be portable but I'm
    not positive. 

  2005-10-05 21:58:46 (r1843) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop.pm M

    "Elly" in IRC suggested that the POE::Loop documentation explicitly
    point out that POE::Loop classes aren't used directly. And that the
    DESCRIPTION point to more detail about how the loops are actually
    used. So here's a fix for that.

    Philip Gwyn discovered a slight problem with his previous patch.
    Increasing the concurrency limit wouldn't resume the listener. This

    Philip Gwyn added a Concurrency parameter to PoCo::Server::TCP. It

    Removed a delete() that was used to close a connection. Server::TCP
    doesn't require such heavy-handed methods anymore.
