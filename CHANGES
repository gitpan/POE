    Some people may be using POE without actually reading the docs.
    Furthermore, they may go on to rant about the side effects in obscure
    places. Recommend reading the documentation in one of POE's most
    "infamous" warnings.

    Explain the likely cause and solution for the "Child process (pid)

    leaking processes.

    Add error number to signal pipe errors. Windows doesn't always have
    an error string for some of winsock's wacky error numbers.

  2009-07-22 07:45:31 (r2593) by rcaputo; poe/MANIFEST M

    Try to speed up the tests by triggering the children to exit upon
    demand rather than after a certain amount of time. Doesn't seem
    significant on my G4 laptop, but it might be on faster machines.

    Run perltidy & convert all tabs to spaces. No actual code changed
    this time around. It's bad to mix semantic changes with stylistic
    ones. The semantic changes get lost.

  poe/t/90_regression/rt47966-sigchld.t A

    Added rt47966-sigchld.t which tortures the signal-pipe with CHLD, for
    testing

    on win32. Maybe this test should be moved to POE::Test::Loops 

  2009-07-21 19:24:24 (r2588) by gwyn17
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm M

    Win32 fixes : - Assign fake numbers (>=128) to signals that don't

    Apply Philip Gwyn's second patch from rt.cpan.org #47966. This one
    builds upon his earlier patch on the same ticket. It reinitializes
    POE's signal handlers in child processes after has_forked() is
    called. It documents has_forked() and USE_SIGNAL_PIPE. It renames the
    _top methods to _bottom to follow interrupt handler semantics. It
    avoids a race condition by blocking signals for the duration of pipe
    rebuilding. 

  2009-07-20 16:27:13 (r2584) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm M

    Gcola on IRC discovered that the internal signals socket wasn't
    compatible with select() on Windows. This patch makes it a plain
    socket when POE is running on Windows.

    Apply Philip Gwyn's patch to deliver signals via pipe rather than
    directly into the queue. This avoids queue re-entrancy during find or
    modification operations, which has previously caused inconsistencies
    in the queue, event enqueuing and event dispatch.
    
    Philip's patch may be found along with a great problem description at

    Comment out garbage collection testing at the end of call(). Neither
    the caller's nor the callee's reference count is affected by the
    call() itself. Anything that does affect the count should be GC
    tested separately. All tests pass, which probably means we need new
    tests. Thanks to DrGeek on IRC for asking an insightful question
    about call()'s GC.

    Some systems, especially SunOS, may return nothing on a sysread()
    while a pipe still contains data. Subsequent reads get the remaining

    skip test because of broken alarm() on MSWin32 with perl5.6

  2009-02-16 10:58:16 (r2442) by apocal; poe/lib/POE/NFA.pm M

    added missing localized nowarnings so we skip 'used only once' on
    TRACE_DESTROY

  2009-02-13 14:36:37 (r2430) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Filter/Line.pm M

  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm M

    fix test failure with 90_regression/bingos-followtail.t on MSWin32
    
    This passes the test on my linux/win32 boxes under perl 5.8.8 and
    5.10.0 BUT WE NEED MORE TESTS, especially for the "Handle"
    parameter... 

  2009-02-10 10:22:20 (r2428) by apocal; poe/lib/POE/Loop/TkCommon.pm M

    Fix a plethora of warnings that were uncovered by lexically scoping

  2009-02-10 07:12:04 (r2425) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Redocument some more, and put in an =over to quiet POD tests for the
    time being. 

  2009-02-10 06:36:41 (r2424) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Session.pm M

    POE::Session would clear $^W unconditionally, which we consider to be
    bad. Localized $^W=0 to only affect the current block of code. Thanks
    to Tod McQuillin on IRC for spotting the problem.

    Do a bit more rewriting. 

  2009-02-03 07:53:57 (r2416) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Document another chunk of POE::Component::Server::TCP, and deprecate
    Args in favor of ClientArgs. 

  2009-02-03 07:48:59 (r2415) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/Event.pm M

    Skip POE::Wheel::ReadLine tests when using Event on darwin. Event
    fails with an "Event: '?? Event.pm:109' was unexpectedly closed"
    error. Event skips a couple of its own tests in t/io.t for the same
    reason, so this seems to be an Event-on-darwin issue. A better
    workaround (or fix) is welcome. I'm sure Event's owner wouldn't mind
    one also. 

  2009-02-02 07:58:33 (r2414) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Rewrote another chunk of documentation.

  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Begin rewriting POE::Component::Server::TCP's documentation. Made a
    couple tweaks to POE::Wheel::Run's as well (since the "Redocument"
    TODO was mistakenly left in there).

    method.

  2008-12-14 08:47:08 (r2406) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Finish first draft rewrite of documentation.

    Note a TODO regarding extra refcounts and signal-based session
    termination.
