  2005-04-18 06:34:52 by rcaputo; tests/30_loops/00_base/k_signals.pm 1.5

    Re-entering Tk::MainLoop too many times, plus signals, seems to
    produce a very deterministic coredump, at least on my current FreeBSD
    perl build. Removed one of three instances of POE::Loop->run(), and
    the crashy-dumpy seems to have gone away. 

  2005-04-18 05:47:34 by rcaputo
  README 1.107; lib/POE.pm 1.192; lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.67

    Documentation tweaks. Bump the version up to 0.31 for release. 

  2005-04-18 05:03:23 by rcaputo; mylib/gen-tests.perl 1.8

    Replace exit(0) in the test templates with POSIX::_exit(0). Some
    libraries (*cough*Tk*cough*) override Perl's exit(), which seems to
    cause trouble with certain tests' exit values. So even if all the
    tests pass, the FILE fails! Augh! This seems to work around it
    nicely, and it's good mojo on OS X, FreeBSD, and ActivePerl. 

  2005-04-13 15:25:25 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.66

    Replaced {STDIN,STDOUT,STDERR}_FILENO with checks for fileno() in the
    close-on-exec loop we have hand-rolled. I'm hoping the regular
    close-on-exec works similarly and won't close STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR if
    their descriptors happen to be >2. 

  2005-04-13 14:56:30 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.51

    Applied Nick Williams' patch to add Hostname to Server::TCP. This is
    a nonambiguous unpacked hostname or address that will be passed
    through inet_aton(). Useful when your hostnames can be four
    characters long, since they look suspiciously like packed addresses
    to length(). 

  2005-04-13 01:48:23 by rcaputo; mylib/PoeBuildInfo.pm 1.5

    Remove Test::More as a dependency. It has a tendency to want lots of
    other modules. That dependency tree eventually leads to installing a
    new version of Perl. Big can of worms. 

  2005-04-12 23:02:19 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resource/Sessions.pm 1.19;
  lib/POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm 1.54;
  tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_tail.pm 1.2

    Uhlarik OndÃej suggested that POE::Wheel::FollowTail should be
    allowed to follow files that don't exist yet. This change adds that
    feature, resolving Uhlarik's rt.cpan.org ticket, number 6048. I hope
    the utf-8 in his name comes through. 

  2005-04-12 22:17:15 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resource/Events.pm 1.14

    A cheap indent fix. 

  2005-04-12 18:40:07 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.36

    Replace the hardcoded "make" utility with $Config::Config{make} so
    it's "nmake" or a cabbage or something on systems with nonstandard
    build tools. 

  2005-04-12 03:59:17 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Filter/HTTPD.pm 1.40

    This guy named Jack has written a WebDAV server with POE and needs
    Filter::HTTPD not to bomb if the request method isn't GET, HEAD, or
    POST. I've applied a modified version of his patch, resolving RT
    ticket #11821. 

  2005-04-12 02:23:28 by rcaputo; mylib/PoeBuildInfo.pm 1.4

    Add Test::Harness to the dependencies in an effort to solve
    rt.cpan.org ticket 12101 (Test::Harness being indexed as part of
    POE). 

  2005-04-12 01:43:22 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.314;
  lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.65; mylib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.53;
  tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm 1.3

    Nick Williams and Merijn Broeren at MSDW did the impossible and
    managed to make POE::Wheel::Run pass actual tests on ActivePerl.
    Damn, they're GOOD! This round of patches isn't 100% perfect (there's
    an issue with the Wheel under POE::Loop::Tk), but I'm confident it'll
    be CPAN-worthy shortly. 

  2005-04-12 01:39:02 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.35

    Part of ExtUtils::AutoInstall's automated install procedure involves
    calling Makefile.PL multiple times with different parameters. This
    was causing the multiple "wanna run network tests?" questions. Now we
    skip the network tests prompt if Makefile.PL is being run again by
    ExtUtils::AutoInstall. 

  2005-03-22 08:04:09 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/ReadWrite.pm 1.71

    Update the code style, but nothing else is changed. This was while
    looking for a memory leak in IKC, but the leak hasn't been
    found/fixed yet. 

  2005-03-22 08:02:51 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.313

    Make the wantarray code in call() more explicit, but don't change the
    semantics. This is while looking for a memory leak in IKC, but the
    leak hasn't been found/fixed yet. 

  2005-03-17 04:30:31 by apocal; lib/POE/Filter/Reference.pm 1.33

    Patched it to cache the default freezer for performance reasons -
    brought up by bline, look at this ticket for more info -

  2005-03-10 20:21:55 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Session.pm 1.110

    Applied Martijn van Beers' patch to make callbacks add reference
    counts just like postbacks do. Thanks, Martijn! 

  2005-02-20 15:56:42 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Filter/HTTPD.pm 1.39

    Applied Martijn van Beers' patch to allow more than one request on a
    single connection. Also adjusted the code's style and spacing. 

  2005-02-09 16:26:48 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Loop/TkCommon.pm 1.12

    Tk::After timers don't use stop(). Rather, they use cancel(). I'm
    shocked---SHOCKED, I SAY---that I never ran into this before. 

  2005-02-03 20:48:56 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.312

    Fix the call() example in the docs. Thanks to Tim Klein for spotting
    the error. 

  2005-02-02 06:02:21 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.64

    Apply Matt Trout's NoSetSid patch to POE::Wheel::Run. When set, it
    disables setsid() in the child process. This closes rt.cpan.org
    ticket #3763.

    Only poll for SIGCHLD when someone actually requests sig(CHLD)
    events. Most programs, most of the time, will be a lot less noisy
    when TRACE_EVENTS and friends are active. This closes rt.cpan.org
    ticket #8821. 

  2005-02-02 02:22:16 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Loop/Select.pm 1.57

    Remove the minimum timeslice constant. Nobody complained while it was
    set to 0, so the old Linux bug it worked around must surely be
    flushed out of most systems by now. 

  2005-01-29 20:11:41 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm 1.53

    Add a tell() method so programs can resume tailing a log where they
    previously left off. Feature requested by Thomas Nagel. Closes

    it should have been.

  lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.310; lib/POE/Session.pm 1.109

    Remove new() from documentation samples. This resolves rt.cpan.org
    ticket 8464. 

  2005-01-28 17:54:25 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Queue.pm 1.4

    Remove link to ADT::PriorityQueue per Sam Carmalt's report. 

  2005-01-28 16:29:19 by lotr; lib/POE/Session.pm 1.108

    Create a instantiate method, so you can override that when you want
    to process extra parameters when subclassing POE::Session. closes bug
    #8450 

  2005-01-28 08:07:35 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.63

    Applying Jay Kim's patch from RT ticket 8807. This adds checks to
    make sure redirection actually works in the child program. Nasty
    deathy things happen if redirection fails, so we should at least know
    why, right? 

  2005-01-28 07:52:45 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.62

    Jay Kim reported that setsid() wasn't being effectively called. It
    would have thrown an "Undefined subroutine" error had it not been
    encased in eval{}. Applied Jay's patch. 

  2005-01-28 07:48:41 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Session.pm 1.107

    Fix a typo in the documentation, thanks to an anonymous tip in

    Martin Ferrari pointed out that there's an annoying warning when
    using POE::Component::Server::TCP in the undocumented AF_UNIX mode.
    This commit applies his patch and adds his test case so it won't
    happen again.

  tests/90_regression/rt1648-tied-stderr.t 1.2

    This regression test requires fork(), but it didn't skip if the
    system can't support fork(). This commit addresses rt.cpan.org ticket
    #9808 and testers.cpan.org report #176869 by skipping the tests on
    lame platforms.

    symbols it needs. This indicates a Great Need to have that filter
    tested properly. Also bumped POE.pm to 0.3007 for a quick bugfix
    release. 

  2004-12-30 20:58:42 by rcaputo; lib/POE.pm 1.189

    Khisanth on IRC reported a problem with the signals test. Somni
    tracked the problem down to a change in Test::More behavior. Once I

    Resolve rt.cpan.org #1648. Tied STDOUT, STDERR would cause
    POE::Wheel::Run child processes to eat output, never sending it back
    to the parent. This change unties STDOUT, STDERR if they're tied,
    griping at the user in the process. So to speak. 

  2004-11-27 16:25:03 by rcaputo; lib/POE.pm 1.185

    POE 0.3003 seems to be stable. The first couple CPAN testers' reports
    came back PASS rather than FAIL, anyway. Bump the version te 0.3004

    Increase minor version for another 0.30 fix release. Hopefully the

  2004-11-26 22:13:07 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.112

    Oh, and we'll need to distribute PoeBuildInfo.pm, so put it in

    Switch from variables to "constant" subroutines. Just because it
    compiles, and it looks like it's runnig, doesn't mean it works. Check
    the messages more carefully before committing next time. 

  2004-11-26 19:02:19 by rcaputo; mylib/Makefile-5004.pm 1.33

    Fix a syntax error, and have "make dist" fail all the time under old
    versions of Perl. 

  2004-11-26 18:53:12 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.34

  2004-11-26 18:51:21 by rcaputo
  mylib/Makefile-5004.pm 1.32; mylib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.51

    Use PoeBuildInfo.pm rather than hardcode common data in both versions
    of Makefile.pm. 

  2004-11-26 18:49:55 by rcaputo; mylib/PoeBuildInfo.pm 1.1

    Moved prerequisites, recommended modules, file cleanup configuration,
    and a few other bits into a common library. The same data is used by
    the 5.004 and 5.005 versions of Makefile.PL, and it's also needed by
    the new gen-meta.perl utility. 

  2004-11-26 18:47:57 by rcaputo; mylib/gen-meta.perl 1.1

    Moved the META.yml generation to a separate utility. This lets us
    build a proper META.yml without Build.PL fouling up installation and
    testing. It also avoids moving the Module::Build code into
    Makefile.PL, where it would become a mandatory prerequisite. It's
    only used during "make dist" anyway. 

  2004-11-26 18:41:00 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.111

    Remove Build.PL. CPANPLUS spots it and tries to build POE with it,
    which wouldn't be so bad if Module::Build didn't eat test.pl's
    STDOUT. Hilarity (such as this CPAN testers failure) ensues:
    
    test....FAILED before any test output arrived FAILED--1 test script
    could be run, alas--no output ever seen 

  2004-11-26 16:41:38 by rcaputo; mylib/Makefile-5004.pm 1.31

    The test reports are generated based on which perl is running. The
    5.004 makefile would run the reports under whichever perl was caught
    first in the user's path. This commit propagates the perl version
    that was used to run Makefile.PL down to the test report.

    Clean cup! Clean cup! Move down! Move down!
    
    In this case, move up. Move the version up for another release. 

  2004-11-25 21:09:02 by rcaputo; mylib/testreport.pl 1.15

    I broke the test report tool when I renamed the test directories.
    Furthermore, the tool checked in Makefile, and the whole point of
    renaming the directory was to get them OUT of Makefile. It should be
    fixed now.

    Module::Build seems to enable YAML support at install time. If you
    don't have YAML then, then you don't get full META.yml files later
    on.
    
    Bump the release to 0.3001. This distribution's built AFTER
    reinstalling YAML then Module::Build at gunpoint.

    POE::Filter::Reference wasn't loading Compress::Zlib due to require()

  2004-11-25 16:56:22 by rcaputo; mylib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.50

    Combine the core requirements for ExtUtils::AutoInstall and MakeMaker
    into one hash so they can be changed together at once. 

  2004-11-25 16:47:48 by rcaputo; mylib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.49

    times. 

  2004-11-25 16:12:54 by rcaputo; mylib/ExtUtils/AutoInstall.pm 1.7

    Skip the event loop restarting test if we're using Tk and a

    The two-arg binmode() call wasn't needed. It was a vestige of

  2004-11-24 21:17:40 by rcaputo; mylib/gen-tests.perl 1.7

    Disable the XS tests, seeing as we don't have any XS to test yet. I
    don't need to answer a bunch of questions about them at this time. 

  2004-11-24 16:41:59 by rcaputo; mylib/gen-tests.perl 1.6

    Perl 5.005_04 was not properly setting $! on important sysread()

    So, recent versions of Tk trap exit() when it's called from BEGIN{}
    or eval{}. It croaks rather than exiting, which makes it a little
    harder for tests to bail out under Tk.
    
    This commit uses CORE::exit() to bypass Tk's trap. It also prints the

    exit on their own when skipping entire test files.

    Clear $! if syswrite() returns successfully.
    
    POE wheels check $! to detect driver errors. Some tied filehandle
    classes (this time Devel::SerialPort) don't clear $! on success.
    POE::Wheel::ReadWrite would see this as an error condition, and bad
    things would happen. Clearing $! on success makes wheel operations
    more robust.

    Ever since the experimental stop() was added, and run() was
    resumable, it annoyed me that combining them with POE::Wheel::Run---
    to run POE kernels in child processes--- would not recalculate the
    child kernels' IDs. As you may know, kernel IDs are meant to be
    globally unique. They're a hash of the machine address, process ID,
    and creation time. So it seems to make sense that spawned off POE
    processes should have IDs different from their parents.
    
    This change forces a kernel ID recalculation whenever stop() is
    called.

    After a lengthy study into the reasons for Term::ReadKey failing, it
    was discovered that Perl 5.8.0 is to blame, most likely under
    particular versions of the Linux kernel, or gcc, or a combination of
    kernel AND gcc. Versions of Perl other than 5.8.0 work under the same
    combinations of kernel and gcc, however. This commit documents the
    research results, provides a test case to determine if "your" system
    suffers from the problem, and recommends alternatives.

    Applying a patch by Martijn van Beers. This change adds syntax for
    loading POE::Loop classes explicitly from POE::Kernel's import(). It
    also adds code to POE.pm's import() that transfers Loop classes to
    the new syntax. The upshot is that you can load classes explicitly
    rather than let POE::Kernel figure things out. This is especially
    important for event loops that identify as two or more event loops
    (such as Glib and Gtk2).

    Ton Hospel discovered that stop() from some event handlers causes the
    session that called it to be reaped twice. The second reap triggers
    an inconsistency error when ASSERT_DEFAULT is enabled. This patch
    adds a check to see whether a session is dead by the time its handler
    returns (and bypasses a lot of moot garbage collection in the rare
    cases that it is). It adds a performance penalty across the board.
    There's probably a better way, but this is more immediate. This patch
    also includes Ton's test case as a proper regression test.

  lib/POE/Loop/TkCommon.pm 1.9; lib/POE/Queue/Array.pm 1.6

    Ton Hospel made a couple interesting observations about POE's event
    loop. First, the code could be tightened up. Perl assignments are
    relatively expensive, and restructuring the code to avoid them means
    a few percent increase in performance. His example appears as a
    comment in POE::Queue::Array, marked with his name.
    
    His second observation is that the Tk loop is about twice as slow as
    it should be. Our workaround for high-priority Tk timers is rather
    stupid. Ton works around it by maintaining separate "immediate" and
    timer queues, and not using Tk to drive the immediate events. I've
    commented on his idea in POE::Loop::TkCommon.

    This commit moves signal deprecations forward. It incorporates a
    number of changes:
    
    POE has stopped dispatching _signal publicly. It's still used
    internally, but programs will not receive it. Attempting to register
    a _signal event handler will still result in a fatal error, however.
    This has the nice benefit of pushing problems on users rather than
    allowing them to fester quietly as bizarre runtime behavior. I'm all
    for that since it's less support problems.
    
    The return values of signal handlers are not significant anymore, and
    you will not receive errors based on them. Using sig_handled() is
    mandatory if you want to handle signals.
    
    POE does not always register handlers for most of %SIG anymore.
    Instead, it registers the handlers as needed when you call
    $kernel->sig(). This means that Ctrl+Z (^Z) WILL suspend any program
    that has not set a TSTP handler.
    
    Signal dispatch is vastly simplified. It should be significantly
    faster, although most programs won't notice a difference. Signal
    dispatch is not that common.
    
    Tests for deprecated behaviors have been removed.
    
    Old emacs-style indenting has been changed to more conventional
    indenting here and there.
    
    The ses_session.pm test sometimes dumps core under Tk. It's not
    consistent, and I'm not sure why.

    Stop excluding tests themselves. The reports don't cover all of the
    POE modules when they are excluded. 

  2004-09-04 23:14:51 by rcaputo; tests/10_units/05_filters/03_http.t 1.2

    This test contained a hardcoded path to t/19_filterchange.t, which I
    just SO totally broke. I replaced it with $0 which seems to work
    pretty well.

    These are the wonderful tests we're adding to replace the stinky old

  Makefile.PL 1.30; mylib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.43

    Migrate the prompt bypassing code out of the 5.5+ Makefile generator
    and into the base Makefile.PL. This is the code that skips
    interaction if STDIN isn't a terminal, or if --default is specified. 

  2004-09-04 22:19:10 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.103; Makefile.PL 1.29;
  mylib/Makefile-5004.pm 1.25; mylib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.42

    Commit the new tests, the new utilities to support them, and
    necessary changes to the install and distribution scripts. 

  2004-09-04 22:07:06 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.102

    Remove the existing tests to make room for the new ones. 

  2004-09-04 21:49:41 by rcaputo; mylib/coverage.perl 1.13

    Ignore modules within the test directory. Also allow coverage of
    individual files on the command line. Great for one-off coverage
    reports to see where a test program is deficient.

  2004-09-02 00:22:43 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.101; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.297

    Renamed POE::Loop::Poll to POE::Loop::IO-Poll, to normalize the way
    event loops are loaded. No exceptions for modules that begin with
    IO:: now. 

  2004-09-01 17:41:08 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.296

    Tweaked the POE::Loop loader to load things like Event::Lib as
    POE::Loop::Event-Lib instead of POE::Loop::Lib. It still strips a
    leading IO:: off the path for legacy (POE::Loop::Poll) support. At
    some point we should probably have SourceForge move Poll.pm to
    IO-Poll.pm and remove the IO stripping code. 

  2004-09-01 16:35:08 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm 1.33

    Nick Williams fixed a bug where pressing Return (^M) from within a
    history search would insert the ^M character into the input line
    before returning it. 

  2004-09-01 11:47:47 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm 1.32

    Nick Williams made extensive revisions to this wheel, adding most
    (all?) of the gnu readline features. Command history search, custom
    key bindings, .inputrc parsing, tab completion, vi and emacs modes,
    it's all there! 

  2004-08-03 20:08:36 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Loop/Event.pm 1.39

    Ton Hospel discovered that POE::Loop::Event does not exit when an
    event handler calls C<die>. The problem turned out to be Event.pm's
    default exception handler, which turns the C<die> into a harmless
    C<warn> and resumes the event loop. Well, POE's all inconsistent
    inside and nothing will happen, so the program stalls hard. Even
    Ctrl+C and Ctrl+\ don't terminate it. This commit replaces the
    default excetion handler, turning it into a harmless C<warn> followed
    by an equally harmless (yet eminently terminal) C<exit>. I originally
    tried to use C<die> inside the exception handler, even setting
    $SIG{__DIE__} = "DEFAULT", but it only sufficed to change the
    original warning into some twisted, recursive form of it. And of
    course the program didn't actually die. Now at least it exits. 

  2004-08-02 21:02:55 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.59

    Mark Lawrence discovered that POE::Wheel::Run's shutdown_stdin()
    method was broken. Probably because it was never actually tested.
    This commit adds tests for shutdown_stdin() under different
    POE::Wheel::Run conduits. It also hopefully fixes the originally
    reported bug. The test itself will need testing on different
    platforms since some systems don't support all of them. Most notably:
    Windows and Solaris. 

  2004-08-01 23:44:21 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.47

    An anoymous tipster pointed out that Acceptor is not valid when using
    the ClientInput mode. Unfortunately the documentation implied that
    they were ok together. Now the docs lead you slightly less astray.

  mylib/Makefile-5004.pm 1.23; mylib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.40

    Replaced the previous commit with File::Spec. This makes the event
    loop loader ueber-portable to anything that runs Perl and has a
    filesystem. Had to add File::Spec as a dependency in the Makefile
    libraries, and did some reformatting while I was there. 

  2004-07-20 15:44:02 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.294

    Improve Windows (and non-UNIXy) operating system compatibility. Using
    modules with strange path separators would cause a startup error. The
    pattern for strange path separators has been expanded to cover most
    of them. Thanks to woggle for bringing the problem to my attention. 

  2004-07-16 14:44:56 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resource/Extrefs.pm 1.10

    Plug at least three memory leaks that only occur when ASSERT_DATA is
    true. 

  2004-07-16 02:37:43 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm 1.11

    Note a potential error condition in the source, and pose the question
    of how to properly handle it. 

  2004-07-16 01:12:28 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resource/Controls.pm 1.3

    Replaced some silent returns with full-on croaks when a bad number of
    parameters is passed to one of POE::Resource::Controls' methods.
    
    Added a return 1; to _data_magic_finalize, since all the finalize
    functions return true on success. 

  2004-07-16 01:10:16 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resource/Sessions.pm 1.18

    Moved more assertions before their corresponding traces. This
    continues to push the errors out to the user, rather than causing
    strange side errors within POE::Kernel. 

  2004-07-16 01:09:08 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resource/Events.pm 1.12

    Clarify what "blocked" events are in some comments. The code confused
    me while I was working on some tests for it, so I thought "more
    comments!" 

  2004-07-15 21:20:45 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resource/Sessions.pm 1.17

    Moved parameter test assertions before their corresponding traces.
    This way the assertions can bail out before the traces cause more
    errors deeper within POE (where the messages have less meaning). 

  2004-07-15 20:00:45 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resource/Sessions.pm 1.16

    Add messages to the _trap() calls for various forms of internal
    inconsistency. Perhaps a lot of them can be removed once the test
    coverage gets close to its maxima. 

  2004-07-15 14:03:29 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resource/Events.pm 1.11

    Comment some code to increment event reference counts. It's only used
    in one place, so it's not a separate method like the decrement code.

    Client:: and Server::TCP. 

  2004-07-15 13:58:10 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.293

    The description of aliases was horrible. Now it's rewritten. 

  2004-07-13 03:46:50 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel.pm 1.19

    Changed the way wheel IDs are allocated, so the first one evar is 1
    (not 2). Added a private (also not documented) mutator to reset the
    internal wheel ID counter so the tests can verify that IDs will be
    reused properly after Perl's integer type rolls over (if evar). Oh,
    and I documented that the POE::Wheel functions are called as just
    that---functions, not class methods. This detail confused me while
    writing some tests, and that's never a good thing. 

  2004-07-13 03:43:48 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Loop/PerlSignals.pm 1.5

    The SIGCHLD signal handler was not actually used. Instead we've been
    polling for SIGCHLD for the longest time. So I removed the handler.
    It was either that or listen to Devel::Cover complain "Oh, you're not
    using this code!" every time. Bastard. :) 

  2004-07-11 06:30:53 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Loop/TkCommon.pm 1.7

    The Tk event loop wouldn't end with TRACE_DEFAULT on (as in the
    tests). It expected the exhausted event queue to have only one event
    in it (the SIGCHLD polling event). With TRACE_DEFAULT, however, there
    are two. The second is for runtime statistics gathering. This change
    accounts for the second event when gathering statistics. 

  2004-07-11 05:46:30 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.292

    Note some TODOs in the source. One's an ugly bit of logging---a
    double message if a _trap isn't caught by eval. The other is a need
    to exercise some code should waitpid() return a strange value. That's
    an obscure assertion. It ensures that the operating system behaves
    according to expectations (something that doesn't always happen,
    especially when running on Strange New Systems). 

  2004-07-11 04:29:42 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.291

    Replaced the use of some public API functions with the private API
    functions they translate to. This reduces a level of indirection
    inside POE::Kernel's extra reference count management (yay,
    efficiency) and allows parameter errors to be reported correctly
    (yay, correctness).
    
    Oh, and I corrected a couple typos in some comments. Whee! 

  2004-07-11 01:03:49 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.290

    Correct a typo in an error message. Also tidied up some whitespace. 

  2004-07-10 18:43:38 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.289

    _trap_death() was not dying with the correct message. Now it should
    be. 

  2004-07-05 22:39:07 by rcaputo
  MANIFEST 1.100; MANIFEST.SKIP 1.8; mylib/coverage.perl 1.12

    Switch from our homegrown Devel::Trace-based test coverage reporter

  lib/POE/Resource/Sessions.pm 1.15; lib/POE/Session.pm 1.100

    Include the _stop event handler's return value in the _child "lose"
    event.
    
    (!!!) Programs that rely on the child session receiving _stop after
    the parent receives a _child event will be negatively affected by
    this change. The order of these events has been reversed so _stop's
    return value can be passed to the parent session along with _child. 

  2004-06-22 19:05:02 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.287

    Patched a doc nit noticed by Andrew A. Chen. Thanks, dude!

  2004-06-03 22:03:15 by rcaputo; mylib/testreport.pl 1.14

    POE.pm was moved during a recent directory restructuring. The test
    report generator did not know where to find it, so it silently
    reported an empty-versioned POE. This change moves the POE module
    load before tests, and makes it a fatal error if POE can't be loaded.
    It also includes the new library directory, so POE can be loaded.
    This should resolve RT ticket 6143. 

  2004-06-03 18:40:24 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm 1.10

    Improve filehandle tracing while verifying a last minute bug report.

  2004-05-24 22:07:03 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.284

    Clarify the description of session lifespans when aliases are in
    effect. This is in response to a comment by Matt Cashner. 

  2004-05-24 21:50:25 by rcaputo; mylib/testreport.pl 1.13

    Set the PERL_DL_NONLAZY environment variable for the test report
    generator's harness. I am hoping this will solve some of the
    differences in behavior between "make test" and "make testreport". 

  2004-05-24 21:48:20 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm 1.77

    Specify the address family and socket type to getaddrinfo() calls.
    Whereas they pass on Mac OS X, the calls will fail without these
    parameters on less forgiving systems like FreeBSD.

  lib/POE/Preprocessor.pm 1.32; lib/POE/Resources.pm 1.9

    Lance Braswell made some specific recommendations for using
    POE::Preprocessor with PerlApp. This commit notes the dynamically
    loaded POE::Resource classes, and it relaxes the error checking for
    missing modules in POE::Resources. 

  2004-05-24 04:34:09 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm 1.76

    Migrated the Socket6 code from the deprecated gethostbyname2() to the
    current standard getaddrinfo(). The new call is heavy on
    context-sensitive features, but it combines gethostbyname2() and
    pack_sockaddr_in6() so it's not all bad. Also, Solaris should like
    it, so this closes RT#6191.
    
    Oh, and I made the t/29_sockfact6.t skip messages a little more
    informative.
    
    As usual, CVS is committing touched files along for the ride. It
    doesn't matter that their content hasn't changed.

    bill of health....

    Ton Hospel discovered that POE::Loop::Event wasn't terminating when a

  2004-04-25 15:05:36 by rcaputo; mylib/cvs-log.perl 1.7

    Add command line switches, and normalize whitespace so the results
    are more machine friendly. 

  2004-04-25 14:58:34 by rcaputo; lib/POE.pm 1.173

    Increase version number for release candidate. 

  2004-04-25 14:43:48 by rcaputo; samples/README.samples 1.2

    Remove the dead files.

    find the tests in a different (less shell dependent) way so that
    tools like testreport work as expected

  lib/POE/Wheel/ListenAccept.pm 1.29; lib/POE/Wheel/ReadWrite.pm 1.68;
  lib/POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm 1.75

    (!!) complete XyzState to XyzEvent transition. This removes all
    errors and warnings caused by use of the old State parameters in
    Wheels. all tests pass in 5.004_005, 5.005_004, 5.6.2, and 5.8.3

    merge in lotr's try_alloc patch. closes rt #6045

    unfortunately there are really two patches in here. first, remove the
    "no warnings" calls that were breaking poe on perls older than 5.6.
    replace them with $^W invocations as suggested by perllexwarn.
    second, fix the TRACE_FILE magic that was causing older perls to lose
    their mind. the comments here explain this in detail so i wont bother
    explaining it here. its kind of magic but works well. i have tested
    all this on 5.004 and 5.8.3 and all is well there (at least in
    relation to this patch - theres more to come in 5.004 land)
