  2009-03-07 19:08:57 (r2496) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Another development release. This one relies on the latest
    POE::Test::Loops changes.

  2009-03-07 19:07:45 (r2495) by rcaputo; poe/mylib/PoeBuildInfo.pm M

    We need POE::Test::Loops 1.004 or later now.

  poe/t/90_regression/rt39872-sigchld-stop.t A; poe/MANIFEST M

    Add Philip Gwyn's test for a failure for POE::Kernel to stop if
    lingering processes are around without a sig_child() to reap them. 

  2009-03-02 20:52:40 (r2490) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Filter.pm M

    Gcola discovered that we don't explain POE::Filter get() and
    get_one() return values when there's nothing to return. 

  2009-03-02 20:19:54 (r2489) by bingosnet; poe/lib/POE/Session.pm M

    Fixed typo in =head1 EVENTS; 

  2009-03-02 20:17:53 (r2488) by bingosnet
  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadWrite.pm M; extras/smoker.perl M

    Corrected typo in =head1 NAME

  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm M;

    Restrict what Fcntl exports. Bump up the versions for a new test
    release.

  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Curses.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Pipe.pm M;

    Backport the Fcntl tweak to the rest of the POE distribution - thanks
    dngor for pointing this out!

  2009-03-01 20:06:23 (r2479) by apocal
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm M

    tweaked the F_GETFL detection routine to be more portable, thanks
    dngor/p5p for the help!

  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M;
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm M

    Move around some POSIX constants so they're used where they're
    needed. 

  2009-02-28 18:15:48 (r2473) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Another developer release for 5.6.2 testing.

  2009-02-28 17:36:13 (r2472) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm M

    Add even more fcntl() diagnostic information for a failure the cpan
    testers are seeing on 5.6.2.

  2009-02-27 20:33:51 (r2471) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm M

    Fix a SYNOPSIS typo, discovered on IRC by Gcola.

  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Loop/PerlSignals.pm M;
  poe/MANIFEST M

    Apply Philip Gwyn's testcase and patch for an end-time hang when
    USE_SIGCHLD is enabled, POE::Kernel is idle, but there are one or
    more outstanding child processes waiting to be reaped. The hang was
    caused by clearing $SIG{CHLD}, which would never allow POE::Kernel's
    "we have child processes" flags to be cleared. Resolves rt.cpan.org
    #39872. 

  2009-02-25 07:58:55 (r2466) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    New test release.

  2009-02-25 07:57:54 (r2465) by rcaputo
  poe/t/10_units/01_pod/02_pod_coverage.t M

    Avoid a lot of warnings, which are the inevitable result of loading
    all POE modules, even the ones which are alternate implementations of
    the same methods.

  2009-02-25 07:48:14 (r2464) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm M

    Improve fcntl() error messages to help track down a 5.6.2 failure. 

  2009-02-22 19:48:13 (r2461) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Time for a developer release, to test all the changes that have
    accumulated so far.

  2009-02-22 18:51:40 (r2457) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Try to clarify the _trap() message so that people look above the trap
    for problems within their own programs. 

  2009-02-22 18:44:15 (r2456) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/NFA.pm M

    Reformat some contributed code. 

  2009-02-22 07:45:28 (r2455) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm M

    Bypass errors when trying to ignore filehandles whose fileno() are
    not defined.

  2009-02-18 10:02:54 (r2454) by bingosnet
  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadWrite.pm M

    Fixed some of the links in ReadWrite POD

  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M;
  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops/wheel_readline.pm M

    Resolve rt.cpan.org #38974, reported by Jari Bonte. If TERM is
    misset, we will skip the POE::Wheel::ReadLine test rather than fail. 

  2009-02-17 07:28:32 (r2449) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm M

    Resolve rt.cpan.org #37938, reported by Rob Bloodgood. 

  2009-02-17 06:42:00 (r2448) by apocal
  poe/t/00_info.t A; poe/MANIFEST M

    added placeholder test in root t/ directory to get around

    This passes the test on my linux/win32 boxes under perl 5.8.8 and
    5.10.0 BUT WE NEED MORE TESTS, especially for the "Handle"
    parameter...

  2009-02-10 07:12:04 (r2425) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Redocument some more, and put in an =over to quiet POD tests for the

  2009-02-10 06:36:41 (r2424) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Session.pm M

    POE::Session would clear $^W unconditionally, which we consider to be
    bad. Localized $^W=0 to only affect the current block of code. Thanks
    to Tod McQuillin on IRC for spotting the problem.

    Do a bit more rewriting. 

  2009-02-03 07:53:57 (r2416) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Document another chunk of POE::Component::Server::TCP, and deprecate
    Args in favor of ClientArgs. 

  2009-02-03 07:48:59 (r2415) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/Event.pm M

    Skip POE::Wheel::ReadLine tests when using Event on darwin. Event
    fails with an "Event: '?? Event.pm:109' was unexpectedly closed"
    error. Event skips a couple of its own tests in t/io.t for the same
    reason, so this seems to be an Event-on-darwin issue. A better
    workaround (or fix) is welcome. I'm sure Event's owner wouldn't mind
    one also. 

  2009-02-02 07:58:33 (r2414) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Rewrote another chunk of documentation.

  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Begin rewriting POE::Component::Server::TCP's documentation. Made a
    couple tweaks to POE::Wheel::Run's as well (since the "Redocument"
    TODO was mistakenly left in there). 

  2009-01-27 08:21:31 (r2410) by rcaputo

    Add POE::Test::Loops to config_requires, so modern systems can
    install it before Makefile.PL runs. Allow gen-tests.pl to fail
    gracefully if POE::Test::Loops isn't installed. Remove a bunch of

  2008-04-28 06:16:20 (r2319) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Per Marc Lehmann's feedback, I have documented how to avoid a
    potential race condition when catching child processes with
    sig_child(). Basically, if you want sig_child() to catch a process,
    call the method in the same event handler that forked the process.
    Otherwise POE::Kernel may reap the process before sig_child() is
    called. 

  2008-04-26 09:13:50 (r2318) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

  poe/t/10_units/04_drivers/01_sysrw.t M

    Simulate a driver get() error by reading from a write-only
    filehandle. I suspect that Perl 5.6.2 is reporting the act of reading
    from a closed fielhandle as an EOF rather than an error, so reading
    from a write-only filehandle may trigger different behavior. 

  2008-03-23 01:31:21 (r2296) by rcaputo
  poe/t/10_units/05_filters/03_http.t M

    Looks like Perl 5.8.7 mistreats my @x = $o->method() =~ m//g; as an
    lvalue subroutine motification, or something. Split it into a scalar
    assign, and bind the match to the scalar rather than a method return
    value.

    Make SIGDIE asynchronous. It will no longer interrupt long chains of
    events (such as _parent/_child chains during session creation and
    destruction).
    
    Exceptions in _stop is currently untrappable, as the asynchronous
    SIGDIE will have nowhere to be delivered. They will cause POE::Kernel
    to "gracefully" die at the end of _stop's dispatch.
    
    SIGDIE propagation follows the normal rules with one new addition:
    The signal also proragates from the target session upwards through
    parent, grandparent, and so on. It will not be dispatched to children
    of ancestor sessions. It will not be dispatched to POE::Kernel
    itself.
    
    Nearly all regression tests pass. The notable exception is Jonathan
    Steinert's recursive signal tests. They have become moot since SIGDIE
    is not recursive anymore.

    Fixed a pod error that was making pod test fail.
    
    Applied a patch from pravus to fix double InputEvents being triggered
    when tailing an empty file on *BSD.
    
    <+pravus> basically what i am seeing is that if you create a file and
    stat() it before you

    write to it, rdev will be 0. then, once the file is written to, the
    rdev changes. <+pravus> that's causing Wheel::FollowTail to read
    until EOF (getting the line you just wrote),

    reset the file and then re-read (getting the line again).

    According to the CPAN testers (bless their souls), POE 0.9989 failed
    at least four times due to bind() errors. Mainly addresses already in

    tests that failed to bind to a random free port rather than hardcoded
    numbers. They should be a lot more resilient to this sort of error.
