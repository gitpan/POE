    POE::Pipe and its subclasses work best using Cygwin's pipe(), not
    IO::Socket. Previous Cygwin versions work better with sockets. If
    01_sysrw.t hangs for you, upgrade your Cygwin and its Perl.

  2010-02-14 20:18:00 (r2804) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/NFA.pm M

    Some code cleanup in POE::NFA.
    
    Revision 2803 is mistaken. Rob Hildred reported the problem and
    provided the test case that was instrumental in helping me resolve
    it. And the bug report was rt.cpan.org 53517. I mistakenly assumed
    the currently open tab was the same ticket I was debugging. 

  2010-02-14 20:10:56 (r2803) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/NFA.pm M

    Fix state bleed between POE::NFA instances.
    
    Resolve rt.cpan.org 53682 reported by Serguei Trouchelle. Thank you,
    Serguei, for a very useful test case. 

  2010-02-14 08:50:27 (r2802) by rcaputo
  poe/t/10_units/03_base/19_detach_start.t M

    Replace the detach-during-start test with an enhanced test that
    Olivier Mengué contributed in rt.cpan.org #54588. 

  2010-02-14 04:41:28 (r2801) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Applied Andrew Feren's patch to avoid a POE::Wheel::Run memory leak
    when running under Windows. Should resolve rt.cpan.org #50068. 

  2010-02-14 04:29:21 (r2800) by rcaputo
  poe/t/90_regression/meh-startstop-return.t M

    Remove dependency on Test::Exception (it appears to be unused). Fix a
    spot of tab damage while I'm in there. 

  2010-02-14 02:52:44 (r2799) by rcaputo; poe/mylib/PoeBuildInfo.pm M

    Rely upon the latest POE::Test::Loops.

  2010-02-14 02:49:12 (r2798) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm M

    Resolve rt.cpan.org #54319. In polling mode, the wheel wasn't
    iterating get_one() for the entire input from get_one_start(). As a
    result, only one log line was returned per PollInterval. This change
    iterates through get_one() until all lines are returned. Many thanks
    to Oleg A. Mamontov for opening the ticket, and to Bazerka on
    irc.perl.org #poe for supplying the basis for a test case.

    [rt.cpan.org 51171] Olivier Mengué noticed that kill() returns a
    completely different kind of value on MSWin32. Use his fix.

    [rt.cpan.org 51772] Don't fire EN_CHILD,CHILD_LOSE when
    detach_myself() is called from _start, since the parent session never
    gets EN_CHILD,CHILD_CREATE to begin with. Fixes a bug reported by
    Olivier Mengué, and includes his test case.

  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm M

    Detangle filehandle vs. filename timer callbacks. Simplified each at
    the expense of some redundant code between them. 

  2009-12-26 08:49:24 (r2754) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm M

    Improve reset detection on Windows. Reduce polling when a file is
    idle. 

  2009-11-23 22:03:53 (r2753) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Fix a typo in a code example reported by Hinrik Örn Sigurðsson on
    IRC. 

  2009-11-17 06:44:24 (r2752) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Clarify session multitasking documentation per IRC feedback from a
    person going by the nickname "skor". 

  2009-10-16 05:34:45 (r2751) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Don't bother propagating wantarray() and tracking return values if
    we're not dispatching ET_CALL. 

  2009-10-16 05:33:46 (r2750) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm M

    Eliminate some temporary variables. 

  2009-10-14 22:37:30 (r2749) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Curses.pm M

    mousemask() is very not portable. Remove it.

  2009-10-07 03:58:59 (r2739) by rcaputo; poe/t/00_info.t M

    Display the POE::Test::Loops version, the better to tell when a CPAN
    tester is running mis-matched tests against POE. 

  2009-10-07 01:54:56 (r2738) by rcaputo; poe/mylib/PoeBuildInfo.pm M

    Adjust event and/or reference counts when Kernel options that use

    Redirect STDERR while testing some errors. ASSERT_DEFAULT is on and
    making noise when things are called wrong, even when we do it on
    purpose. 

  2009-10-06 03:35:27 (r2732) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M

    Work around circular references on $self. Uses Scalar::Util::weaken()
    until someone comes up with a better plan. 

  2009-10-06 03:33:15 (r2731) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    doing so on decrement told only half the story. 

  2009-10-05 16:28:57 (r2729) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Set POE_DANTIC=1 before running "make test" to watch the pretty

    Make _data_sig_reset_procs() also stop polling for children. Used as
    part of has_forked() so that child processes don't keep looking for

    Fix some new mark-and-sweep GC debugging output. It was originally
    specialty debugging, and I forgot to convert print() to _warn() when

  2009-10-05 04:54:32 (r2723) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Fix the timing of calling has_forked() from stop(). Also fix the idle
    queue size in child processes so they don't stall if they want to
    rerun POE::Kernel's event loop.

  2009-10-03 20:39:24 (r2714) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Fixed a stop() bug while working on Marius Kjeldahl's test. stop()
    was calling the underlying _data_sig_has_forked() method, but the
    singleton Kernel's has_forked() does some extra necessary cleanup. 

  2009-10-03 20:37:31 (r2713) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Add in a forgotten semaphore pipe write. fork/exec on sane systems
    wasn't properly notifying the parent they were ready, and there were
    a lot of undefined value warnings. Avoid closing intermediate
    filehandles. Undefine them instead, in case there's close() bleed
    across threads. It's just a hunch, to be honest. I'll know more when
    I try this again on Windows.

    !!! Add mark-and-sweep testing for session stopping.
    
    Reduce the number of session GC tests by only checking affected
    sessions at the end of each timeslice, or related dispatch method.
    Changes the timing of _stop callbacks, and it definitely breaks

    Dispatch I/O synchronously rather than enqueuing and dequeuing
    events. This saves a lot of time, but it changes the relative timing
    of I/O dispatch. If it turns out to be significant, then we may have
    to roll it back.

    Skip the signals pipe when RUNNING_IN_HELL. Child "processes" in

    Document that it's good practice to scrap the connection when there's
    a client error.

  poe/t/10_units/05_filters/03_http.t M

    Fixes to POE::Filter::HTTPD: 

    - RFC2616 says a body is implied if we have Content-Encoding or

    Content-Length;

    - C-E w/o C-L is an error for HTTP 1.1;

    - Added copious comments to justify the above;

    - Created ->_reset();

    - If possible, include the request in an error response object;

    - Set ->message on an error response object;

    - Updated documentation. Unit tests for above.

    Comment on the likely cause of the deep recursion noted in
    rt.cpan.org ticket 45109. Waiting for confirmation that Philip Gwyn's
    USE_SIGNAL_PIPE changes haven't fixed this particular problem. 

  2009-08-26 03:52:58 (r2642) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel.pm M

    Explain why wheels can't be altered outside their creator sessions.
    Potentially explains an oblique side effect reported by Sean Pieper
    in rt.cpan.org ticket 45408.

  2009-08-13 05:01:44 (r2630) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Session.pm M

    Added experimental code to allow postbacks and callbacks to be
    weakened, explicitly reducing their reference counts. Untested.
    Resolves rt.cpan.org #48670, submitted by Adam Kennedy. 

  2009-08-10 05:45:09 (r2629) by gwyn17; poe/lib/POE/Loop/Event.pm M

    Hiding Event's exceptions is no longer necessary

  2009-08-09 06:37:09 (r2628) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Events.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Defer rethrowing exceptions until after run() cleans up. Previously
    exceptions would be thrown farther inside POE's dispatcher,
    preventing some important cleanup. This only affects a few people who
    re-run() POE::Kernel after an exception or using $kernel->stop(). 

  2009-08-08 09:06:17 (r2627) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/Event.pm M

    Quiet Event's exception handler. I'm not entirely sure this is a good
    idea, but it's worth a shot.

  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Loop/Event.pm M;
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm M

    Increase filehandle trace verbosity. Add more diagnostic information
    to Event watchers, in case they fail. Slightly optimize
    POE::Wheel::Run destruction. There's no need to unselect file handles
    in modes that were never watched. 

  2009-08-08 07:37:53 (r2624) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/Event.pm M

    Describe Event watchers to aid in debugging.

  poe/t/90_regression/leolo-poe-wheel-run.t A

    Added test to make sure we get the 3 "completion" events from
    POE::Wheel::Run. Multiplied by the 4 conduit types. 

  2009-08-06 10:55:58 (r2621) by gwyn17; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Roll back previous patch. We need to call ->close_slave() on the
    _read handles. Do that instead.

  2009-08-06 07:21:19 (r2620) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Fix case where POE::Wheel::Run CloseEvent doesn't fire on Linux.
    Thanks to Philip Gwyn's investigation and test cases, we found out
    that close() wasn't sufficient to close and destruct slave ptys, so
    the parent processes were keeping them open. Replaced close() with
    $io_pty->close_slave() as needed.

    !!! This change breaks backward compatibility on a relatively unused

    POE::Component::Server::TCP ClientConnected callback.
    
    ClientArgs promised more than it could deliver, and people finally
    noticed. This change backs off supplying the socket in $_[ARG0], and
    it expands ClientArgs' arrayref into @_[ARG0..$#_]. Thanks to Michael
    Fowler for rt.cpan.org #47855 (which this resolves), and POE's

    Initialize the output masks for sigprocmask. Undefined output masks

    http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2009/07/msg4809122.h

    Some people may be using POE without actually reading the docs.
    Furthermore, they may go on to rant about the side effects in obscure
    places. Recommend reading the documentation in one of POE's most
    "infamous" warnings.

    Apply Philip Gwyn's second patch from rt.cpan.org #47966. This one
    builds upon his earlier patch on the same ticket. It reinitializes
    POE's signal handlers in child processes after has_forked() is
    called. It documents has_forked() and USE_SIGNAL_PIPE. It renames the
    _top methods to _bottom to follow interrupt handler semantics. It
    avoids a race condition by blocking signals for the duration of pipe
    rebuilding.

    Gcola on IRC discovered that the internal signals socket wasn't

    Apply Philip Gwyn's patch to deliver signals via pipe rather than
    directly into the queue. This avoids queue re-entrancy during find or
    modification operations, which has previously caused inconsistencies
    in the queue, event enqueuing and event dispatch.

    Comment out garbage collection testing at the end of call(). Neither
    the caller's nor the callee's reference count is affected by the
    call() itself. Anything that does affect the count should be GC
    tested separately. All tests pass, which probably means we need new
    tests. Thanks to DrGeek on IRC for asking an insightful question
    about call()'s GC.

    Some systems, especially SunOS, may return nothing on a sysread()
    while a pipe still contains data. Subsequent reads get the remaining
    data, however. Resolve rt.cpan.org ticket 43252 by retrying a limited
    number of times when sysread() reports that the pipe is empty.

    Apply Philip Gwyn's testcase and patch for an end-time hang when
    USE_SIGCHLD is enabled, POE::Kernel is idle, but there are one or
    more outstanding child processes waiting to be reaped. The hang was
    caused by clearing $SIG{CHLD}, which would never allow POE::Kernel's
    "we have child processes" flags to be cleared. Resolves rt.cpan.org
    #39872.

    Skip POE::Wheel::ReadLine tests when using Event on darwin. Event
    fails with an "Event: '?? Event.pm:109' was unexpectedly closed"
    error. Event skips a couple of its own tests in t/io.t for the same
    reason, so this seems to be an Event-on-darwin issue. A better
    workaround (or fix) is welcome. I'm sure Event's owner wouldn't mind
    one also.
