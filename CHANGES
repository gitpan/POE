    Very large select() timeouts can trigger EINVAL on Mac OSX.

    Sérgio Bernardino reported that POE::Component::Server::IRC's
    synopsis would go into a busy loop when a client tried to connect. It
    turns out that POE::Loop::Select would fail when the component set a
    timeout for a very long time in the future. Cap select() timeouts to
    an hour to avoid the problem.

    [rt.cpan.org 67680] Use IO::Handle::blocking() rather than
    $fh->blocking().

    Some file handles, such as my $fh = do { no warnings; local *FH };
    can't be used as IO::Handle objects. IO::Handle::blocking($fh) seems
    to work, though.

    This was caught by Troy, who was nice enough to open the bug. Thanks!

    Allow ::Run to discard stdio file descriptors

    - Std{in|out|err}Event no longer required - Stdio file descriptor
    discarded for each stdio

    which lacks a corresponding event (except read) - Added option to not
    open stdin - Added option to redirect stdio to/from other filenames
    or filehandles

    - Corresponding fix needed for test-loops

    Work around a consistent timeout issue in Hinrik's POE::Wheel::Run
    test.

    There is a mysterious 5sec delay when starting processes on some
    Windows machines. The consistent, roundish number of seconds makes me
    suspect something environmental, like an antivirus program, but
    that's just a wild guess.

    Thanks to ultramantis on irc.perl.org #poe or letting me access their
    machine with teamviewer. I couldn't reproduce the problem on my own
    systems, so it was vital to see it failing somewhere.

    It adds itself to META.yml, but its presence is misleading for POE's

    Don't block on active child processes at endtime.

    It's important to note that child processes exist, but we don't need
    to wait around for them. Reap the ones that have already exited, and
    alert the user if at least one active process remains after that.
    Return immediately; don't wait for it/them to exit.

    Avoid trying to dispatch SIGDIE to sessions in a POE::Kernel that has

    Allow event handlers to persistently alter $SIG{__DIE__}.

    Prior to this change, modifications to $SIG{__DIE__} in event
    handlers would be lost due to that signal entry being localized. This
    brings up an interesting question: Should the rest of %SIG be
    localized?

    Apply Stephen Oberholtzer's patch to fix a test freeze.

    IO::Handle->blocking() is broken on MSWin32, locking up
    t/10_units/04_drivers/01_sysrw.t in some cases. Stephen provided a
    patch to Perl and to POE to work around the issue. It's portable
    enough that things shouldn't immediately break after Perl is fixed.

    If using POE::Wheel::Run to exec() a program, throw an error if
    STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR do not have respective file descriptors 0, 1
    and 2. Previously, POE::Wheel::Run would just fail to work without
    any indication why. Makes the mysterious issue Hinrik found in
    rt.cpan.org ticket 67798 less so.

    Begin modernizing.

    Wow, I haven't touched this in several years. A bunch of things are
    done in POE and Reflex, and other stuff's just seriously behind the
    times. Start off with things we discussed today in irc.perl.org #poe.
    Delete obsolete ideas. Begin porting the remainders into Vim Outliner
    format.

    Add test for Win32 socket bugfix in commit 8265022

  commit d65590f5c0c065d49a342e94e48b8167f4f5c633

    Resolve a GC timing issue with call(), discovered by flw and
    diagnosed by Nick Perez on POE's mailing list. This passes "make
    test" and should be safe---GC will still be triggered on the next
    sweep if side effects occurred in the called session.

    Fix an indefinite hang in non-blocking connect() failures on Windows.
    Hinrik discovered this in a POE::Component::IRC test case. Apparently
    MSWin32 and Cygwin have more in common than originally expected.

  commit 393b332e05819f7f9e2e8293558da312583fd7ff
  Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
  Date:   Fri Mar 25 18:13:47 2011 -0400
  
    Rekey POE::Resource::FileHandles on file descriptor instead of
    handle.

    iThreads changed filehandle stringification. This change works around
    the issue, making POE that much more iThread-safe (and therefore
    fork-tender on Windows). Thanks, Plixer International for sponsoring
    this and the several recent iThreads/Windows related changes.

    Clear out the event queue by session ID rather than reference.

    I suspect this was causing defunct parent-process events to linger in
    the child-process queue after POE::Kernel->stop() was called. Their
    dispatch in the child process may have caused the "hilarity" I have
    seen in the wild.

  Author: Tom Feist <shabble@metavore.org>
  Date:   Sun Feb 20 13:46:39 2011 +0000
  
    Modified Wheel::Run to accept winsize argument again, using Termios
    TIOCSWINSZ ioctl.

    Probably not portable from *nix, but it's a start.

    Add process IDs to _warn(), _die(), etc. Remove $SIG{__WARN_} and
    $SIG{__DIE__} handlers---they seem to be support for pre-5.6 Perl.

  Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
  Date:   Fri Feb 11 17:39:52 2011 -0500
  
    Standardize non-blocking on IO::Handle's blocking(0) call. This may
    cause problems for systems using Perl older than 5.8.1.

    handling.

    POE::Resource::Sessions and POE::Resource::Signals data structures
    from session references to session IDs.

    Add a sequence number to POE::Kernel's ID.

    Kernels need unique IDs each time they're started, even within the
    same process. Kernels need unique IDs in each thread.
