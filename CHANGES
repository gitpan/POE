    Bump the version for a bugfix release.

  lib/POE/Wheel/ReadWrite.pm 1.72; lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.70

    Abhishek Jain discovered a heretofore obscure socket leakage issue in
    POE::Component::Server::TCP. New connection sockets were passed into
    callbacks as closures, preventing them from being closed timely on
    shutdown unless a session also exited. This commit fixes the problem
    by passing new connections through POE::Session's args parameter
    rather than tying them up in closures. 

  2005-08-10 14:44:08 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.322

    Invoke event handlers in void context if the dispatcher is called in
    void context. Previously handlers would be called in scalar context,
    causing a subtle edge case where objects wouldn't destruct properly. 

  2005-08-10 14:28:16 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm 1.38

    Fix an amazing amount of tab damage. Yes, this commit is entirely to
    fix whitespace.

  tests/90_regression/averell-callback-ret.t 1.1

    Averell pointed out that callbacks via POE::Session->callback() do
    not return their handlers' return values to the caller. This is
    directly contraindicated by the comments. Furthermore, and perhaps
    best, he submitted a small patch to fix it and a proper regression
    test. His report was 100% perfect in all regards (even if his patch
    was a little overzealous). Be like him. 

  2005-07-04 20:32:55 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Session.pm 1.112

    Shorten and sweeten the documentation for postback() and callback().

  tests/90_regression/broeren-win32-nbio.t 1.1

    Apply Merijn Broeren's patch to SocketFactory for ActiveState Perl.
    This improves the non-blocking connect code by not turning
    non-blocking on for ALL sockets created in a process. NBIO is only
    turned on for the ones created by the socket factory.

  tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_tail.pm 1.5

    Cygwin under Virtual PC is just too many layers of emulation.
    Increase the timeout to avoid false failures. 

  2005-06-30 16:39:15 by rcaputo; tests/30_loops/00_base/k_alarms.pm 1.2

    Windows XP under Virtual PC is functional but teh sl0. Increase the
    "reasonable" time factor for the alarm tests in the face of such time
    dilation.

  tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_sf_unix.pm 1.4;
  tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_tail.pm 1.4

    Work around Cygwin quirks in the tests. 1. syswrite() blocks on
    non-blocking pipes, so I moved a test over to internet domain
    sockets. 2. close() on non-blocking sockets writes, so I changed a
    test to use shutdown() instead. 3. Files appear to be opened for
    exclusive access by default, so the Wheel::FollowTail tests can't
    run. This closes rt.cpan.org tickets 11553 and 11053. 

  2005-06-30 03:37:47 by rcaputo
  tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_sf_ipv6.pm 1.6

    Preliminary fixes for coredumps when calling POE::Kernel->run() more
    than once. Will be testing on OSX and ActiveState Perl before this is
    through. 

  2005-06-29 05:44:51 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Loop.pm 1.7

    Explain how POE finds a POE::Loop module. This closes rt.cpan.org
    ticket 7852.

  lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.321; tests/10_units/03_base/11_assert_usage.t 1.4

    Arturas Slajus (with diacriticals, however) reported a bug in POE's
    signal handling (rt.cpan.org ticket 12953). This turned out to be
    caused by calling sig() outside a running session. This change checks
    that methods requiring to be called from running sessions actually
    are, but it only does so when ASSERT_USAGE is enabled.

    Lift POE::Filter::Reference's get() to POE::Filter, and modify most
    of the other POE::Filter subclasses to use it. POE::Filter::HTTPD is
    an exception because it doesnt' have a get_one() function.
    POE::Filter::Stackable's get_one() was rewritten to accommodate the
    change. 

  2005-06-29 02:49:34 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Session.pm 1.111

    Add a mandatory carp() to POE::Session->new() per rt.cpan.org ticket
    8468, and http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.poe/2613 . 

  2005-06-28 22:31:11 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.54

    Deprecate the stinky old TestSetup library in favor of the shiny, and
    way newer Test::More. This finally resolves rt.cpan.org ticket 7558. 

  2005-06-28 06:15:29 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Filter/Reference.pm 1.37

    Fix tab damage I introduced in the last patch to Filter::Reference. 

  2005-06-27 04:32:59 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Filter/Reference.pm 1.36

    Modify get_one() to not destroy the reference's header in the buffer,
    in case it's a partial read and we switch the filter to something
    else. In the past, the reference's header would be lost.

    Make the POE::Filter::* classes inherit from POE::Filter despite that
    they don't use anything in POE::Filter. This allows people to use
    isa() to determine whether things are POE::Filter classes. Closes
    rt.cpan.org ticket #13146.
    
    Cleaned up the syntax somewhat in a few of the files.
    
    I removed a huge chunk of redundant code in POE::Filter::Reference by
    rewriting get() in terms of get_one_start() and get_one(). All tests
    pass. 

  2005-05-30 08:32:56 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.320

    Remove the unused ET_SIGNAL_COMPATIBLE and rename the explicit
    dispatch to ET_SIGNAL_RECURSIVE since that's what it is now. This
    cleans up some vestiges from the signal deprecations. 

  2005-05-30 02:22:49 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.115

    The last two regression tests won't do much good if they aren't in
    the distribution. 

  2005-05-30 02:21:53 by rcaputo
  tests/90_regression/steinert-signal-integrity.t 1.1

    Add a regression test to ensure recursive signal dispatch doesn't
    clobber signal parameters. 

  2005-05-30 02:20:34 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.319

    Put Jonathan Steinert's patch back. Fix recursive signal dispatch to
    use copies of @$etc rather than the original in nested
    _dispatch_event calls. Any future recursive _dispatch_event calls
    will probably need to do the same. 

  2005-05-29 06:13:34 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.318

    Expose and document the new select() methods' arguments pass-through
    parameters.
    
    Modify Jonathan Steinert's @$etc clearing to preserve $_[ARG0] for
    signal events. Recursive dispatch code really needs that. I suspect
    that SIGCHLD dispatch is still broken, as many of the parameters
    passed down to it will be wiped out before the event is dispatched
    everywhere. 

  2005-05-29 06:10:49 by rcaputo
  tests/20_resources/00_base/filehandles.pm 1.3

  2005-05-28 23:56:42 by rcaputo
  tests/90_regression/steinert-passed-wheel.t 1.1

    Add a regression test for hachi's last commit. His commit breaks
    something in SIGIDLE/SIGZOMBIE dispatch (k_aliases.t), and I want to
    be sure I fix that without regressing the issue he fixed. 

  2005-05-28 22:45:02 by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.317; lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm 1.20

    Add pass-through parameters to POE::Kernel's select methods. Values
    passed in this way will be passed back with the I/O events they
    generate. 

  2005-05-25 00:54:57 by hachi; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.316

    Arguments to an event should be cleaned up after the event is called,
    but before we return control back to the Kernel (queued events) or
    the calling Session (called events).

  2005-05-18 23:08:17 by rcaputo; tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm 1.8

    Fall back to a single POE::Kernel->run() in this test because
    multiple entries were crashing ActivePerl + Tk. 

  2005-05-17 07:19:20 by rcaputo; tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm 1.7

    Fix a miscount in the number of skipped tests under Windows. Also
    skip all tests when using Event, as it seems that Event +
    thread-simulated fork() + re-entering the event loop = Breakage. 

  2005-05-16 20:53:37 by hachi; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.315

    Minor documentation gap, and some bad grammar. 

  2005-05-16 05:28:55 by rcaputo; mylib/coverage.perl 1.15

    General cleanups during a Devel::Cover debugging session. Be more
    careful about the steps taken. Display some debugging output.
    Explicitly specify an output directory. 

  2005-05-16 04:09:37 by rcaputo; tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm 1.6

    The restructured tests cause one of the sessions to receive a SIGCHLD
    when it doesn't have a wheel. Now we don't try to call a method on
    that nonexistent wheel. 

  2005-05-15 22:20:59 by apocal; lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.53

    Andrew A. Chen reported on the mailinglist that inet_aton wasn't

  lib/POE/Loop/PerlSignals.pm 1.10; lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm 1.14

    Fix SIGCHLD and SIGPIPE so they are IGNOREd by default. In SIGCHLD's
    case, this means Perl will reap child processes so you don't need to
    register a SIGCHLD handler if you don't care. In SIGPIPE's case, it
    means programs won't die if they mistakenly write to a broken pipe.
    Both situations have occurred since POE stopped setting default
    handlers for these signals. 

  2005-05-15 07:07:16 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Loop/IO_Poll.pm 1.33

    Use better choices for the poll(2) flags when watching filehandles
    for normal (non-expedited/OOB) input and output. Drop the minimum
    poll timeout hack for certain legacy Linux builds (it was 0 anyway). 

  2005-05-15 07:04:51 by rcaputo; tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm 1.5

    Skip the pty tests when IO::Poll or Event are used on Mac OS X. It
    appears that OS X 10.4 has broken poll(2) when used with pseudo-ttys.
    I haven't found a work-around other than to bypass the tests.

  tests/10_units/02_pipes/02_oneway.t 1.3;

    Moved the POE::Pipe::{One,Two}Way test code out of the
    POE::Wheel::Run tests and into their own files. This shouldn't
    sacrifice coverage since the pipe tests don't use event loops anyway. 

  2005-05-15 07:00:12 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resource/Statistics.pm 1.5

  tests/10_units/03_base/11_assert_usage.t 1.3

    Duplicated test, same test is a couple lines up verbatim. 

  2005-05-14 23:48:12 by hachi; mylib/PoeBuildInfo.pm 1.6

    Fix make distclean so test directories (not just the tests
    themselves) are cleaned up. This helps to stop CVS from screaming at
    you if you've run tests and then want to commit some changes (still
    have to run make distclean, but at least it works.) 

  2005-05-14 20:29:02 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.52

    Clear up the purpose and activities of ClientShutdownOnError, at
    least a little bit. 

  2005-04-29 16:42:30 by rcaputo; tests/30_loops/00_base/k_detach.pm 1.2

    Compensate for machines with variable CPU rates. They cause
    hi-resolution time() to bobble backwards by a few milliseconds eveny
    few seconds. This test requires events to run in a certain order, and
    they don't under those circumstances. It may turn out that we need to
    use a timeless priority queue for FIFO events rather than relying on
    the clock to be monotonic.

    Enable support for $kernel->run_one_timeslice() under Tk. I had to
    implement loop_do_timeslice() and replace Tk's MainLoop with a custom
    one in loop_run(). I haven't tested this against the memory leak test
    cases in rt.cpan.org, but I'm hoping this code (which is less twisty)
    will solve those issues as well.

  lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.68; tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm 1.4

    ActiveState Perl + Tk + POE::Wheel::Run + coderefs = Pain.
    ActiveState Perl emulates fork() with iThreads. Only Perl's core
    exit() will properly "exit" a "process". Tk overrides exit() with its
    own XS magic. This seems to kill off the parent "process". When
    POE::Wheel::Run is used to run subroutines (coderefs) in child
    processes, it must somehow exit() the child process, simulating exec.
    Under Windows, that's Perl's core exit(), which is usurped by Tk,
    which causes ALL MANNER OF EVIL! DON'T GO THERE! WE SURE AREN'T!

    Apply Ed W's advice regarding non-blocking connect() in ActiveState
    Perl. His advice works in stand-alone (non-POE) tests, and the change

    tested whether non-blocking connect() works under POE now.

    Re-entering Tk::MainLoop too many times, plus signals, seems to
    produce a very deterministic coredump, at least on my current FreeBSD
    perl build. Removed one of three instances of POE::Loop->run(), and
    the crashy-dumpy seems to have gone away.

  2005-04-18 05:03:23 by rcaputo; mylib/gen-tests.perl 1.8

    Replace exit(0) in the test templates with POSIX::_exit(0). Some
    libraries (*cough*Tk*cough*) override Perl's exit(), which seems to
    cause trouble with certain tests' exit values. So even if all the
    tests pass, the FILE fails! Augh! This seems to work around it
    nicely, and it's good mojo on OS X, FreeBSD, and ActivePerl. 

  2005-04-13 15:25:25 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.66

    Replaced {STDIN,STDOUT,STDERR}_FILENO with checks for fileno() in the
    close-on-exec loop we have hand-rolled. I'm hoping the regular
    close-on-exec works similarly and won't close STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR if
    their descriptors happen to be >2. 

  2005-04-13 14:56:30 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.51

    Applied Nick Williams' patch to add Hostname to Server::TCP. This is
    a nonambiguous unpacked hostname or address that will be passed
    through inet_aton(). Useful when your hostnames can be four
    characters long, since they look suspiciously like packed addresses
    to length(). 

  2005-04-13 01:48:23 by rcaputo; mylib/PoeBuildInfo.pm 1.5

    Remove Test::More as a dependency. It has a tendency to want lots of

    feature, resolving Uhlarik's rt.cpan.org ticket, number 6048. I hope
    the utf-8 in his name comes through.

    A cheap indent fix. 

  2005-04-12 18:40:07 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.36

    Replace the hardcoded "make" utility with $Config::Config{make} so
    it's "nmake" or a cabbage or something on systems with nonstandard
    build tools. 

  2005-04-12 03:59:17 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Filter/HTTPD.pm 1.40

    This guy named Jack has written a WebDAV server with POE and needs
    Filter::HTTPD not to bomb if the request method isn't GET, HEAD, or
    POST. I've applied a modified version of his patch, resolving RT
    ticket #11821. 

  2005-04-12 02:23:28 by rcaputo; mylib/PoeBuildInfo.pm 1.4

    Add Test::Harness to the dependencies in an effort to solve
    rt.cpan.org ticket 12101 (Test::Harness being indexed as part of

    Nick Williams and Merijn Broeren at MSDW did the impossible and
    managed to make POE::Wheel::Run pass actual tests on ActivePerl.
    Damn, they're GOOD! This round of patches isn't 100% perfect (there's
    an issue with the Wheel under POE::Loop::Tk), but I'm confident it'll
    be CPAN-worthy shortly. 

  2005-04-12 01:39:02 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.35

    Part of ExtUtils::AutoInstall's automated install procedure involves
    calling Makefile.PL multiple times with different parameters. This
    was causing the multiple "wanna run network tests?" questions. Now we
    skip the network tests prompt if Makefile.PL is being run again by
    ExtUtils::AutoInstall. 

  2005-03-22 08:04:09 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/ReadWrite.pm 1.71

    Update the code style, but nothing else is changed. This was while
    looking for a memory leak in IKC, but the leak hasn't been
    found/fixed yet. 

  2005-03-22 08:02:51 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.313

    Make the wantarray code in call() more explicit, but don't change the
    semantics. This is while looking for a memory leak in IKC, but the
    leak hasn't been found/fixed yet.

    Remove the minimum timeslice constant. Nobody complained while it was
    set to 0, so the old Linux bug it worked around must surely be
    flushed out of most systems by now. 

  2005-01-29 20:11:41 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm 1.53

    Applying Jay Kim's patch from RT ticket 8807. This adds checks to
    make sure redirection actually works in the child program. Nasty
    deathy things happen if redirection fails, so we should at least know
    why, right? 

  2005-01-28 07:52:45 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.62

    Jay Kim reported that setsid() wasn't being effectively called. It
    would have thrown an "Undefined subroutine" error had it not been
    encased in eval{}. Applied Jay's patch.

    of Makefile.pm. 

  2004-11-26 18:49:55 by rcaputo; mylib/PoeBuildInfo.pm 1.1

    Moved prerequisites, recommended modules, file cleanup configuration,
    and a few other bits into a common library. The same data is used by
    the 5.004 and 5.005 versions of Makefile.PL, and it's also needed by
    the new gen-meta.perl utility. 

  2004-11-26 18:47:57 by rcaputo; mylib/gen-meta.perl 1.1

    Moved the META.yml generation to a separate utility. This lets us
    build a proper META.yml without Build.PL fouling up installation and
    testing. It also avoids moving the Module::Build code into
    Makefile.PL, where it would become a mandatory prerequisite. It's
    only used during "make dist" anyway. 

  2004-11-26 18:41:00 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.111

    Remove Build.PL. CPANPLUS spots it and tries to build POE with it,
    which wouldn't be so bad if Module::Build didn't eat test.pl's
    STDOUT. Hilarity (such as this CPAN testers failure) ensues:
    
    test....FAILED before any test output arrived FAILED--1 test script
    could be run, alas--no output ever seen 

  2004-11-26 16:41:38 by rcaputo; mylib/Makefile-5004.pm 1.31

    The test reports are generated based on which perl is running. The
    5.004 makefile would run the reports under whichever perl was caught
    first in the user's path. This commit propagates the perl version
    that was used to run Makefile.PL down to the test report.

    I broke the test report tool when I renamed the test directories.

    Module::Build seems to enable YAML support at install time. If you
    don't have YAML then, then you don't get full META.yml files later
    on.
    
    Bump the release to 0.3001. This distribution's built AFTER
    reinstalling YAML then Module::Build at gunpoint.

    Perl 5.005_04 was not properly setting $! on important sysread()
    errors. While debugging, I discovered a simple no-op that causes $!
    to be set properly. This commit adds the work-around, and now the
    SysRW driver tests pass.

    So, recent versions of Tk trap exit() when it's called from BEGIN{}
    or eval{}. It croaks rather than exiting, which makes it a little
    harder for tests to bail out under Tk.
    
    This commit uses CORE::exit() to bypass Tk's trap. It also prints the
    skip messages manually since Test::More and POE's own TestSetup both
    exit on their own when skipping entire test files.

    Clear $! if syswrite() returns successfully.
    
    POE wheels check $! to detect driver errors. Some tied filehandle
    classes (this time Devel::SerialPort) don't clear $! on success.
    POE::Wheel::ReadWrite would see this as an error condition, and bad
    things would happen. Clearing $! on success makes wheel operations
    more robust.

    Ever since the experimental stop() was added, and run() was
    resumable, it annoyed me that combining them with POE::Wheel::Run---
    to run POE kernels in child processes--- would not recalculate the
    child kernels' IDs. As you may know, kernel IDs are meant to be
    globally unique. They're a hash of the machine address, process ID,
    and creation time. So it seems to make sense that spawned off POE
    processes should have IDs different from their parents.
    
    This change forces a kernel ID recalculation whenever stop() is
    called.

    After a lengthy study into the reasons for Term::ReadKey failing, it
    was discovered that Perl 5.8.0 is to blame, most likely under
    particular versions of the Linux kernel, or gcc, or a combination of
    kernel AND gcc. Versions of Perl other than 5.8.0 work under the same
    combinations of kernel and gcc, however. This commit documents the
    research results, provides a test case to determine if "your" system
    suffers from the problem, and recommends alternatives.

    Applying a patch by Martijn van Beers. This change adds syntax for
    loading POE::Loop classes explicitly from POE::Kernel's import(). It
    also adds code to POE.pm's import() that transfers Loop classes to
    the new syntax. The upshot is that you can load classes explicitly
    rather than let POE::Kernel figure things out. This is especially
    important for event loops that identify as two or more event loops
    (such as Glib and Gtk2).

    Ton Hospel discovered that stop() from some event handlers causes the

    adds a check to see whether a session is dead by the time its handler
    returns (and bypasses a lot of moot garbage collection in the rare
    cases that it is). It adds a performance penalty across the board.
    There's probably a better way, but this is more immediate. This patch
    also includes Ton's test case as a proper regression test.

  lib/POE/Loop/TkCommon.pm 1.9; lib/POE/Queue/Array.pm 1.6

    Ton Hospel made a couple interesting observations about POE's event
    loop. First, the code could be tightened up. Perl assignments are
    relatively expensive, and restructuring the code to avoid them means
    a few percent increase in performance. His example appears as a
    comment in POE::Queue::Array, marked with his name.
    
    His second observation is that the Tk loop is about twice as slow as
    it should be. Our workaround for high-priority Tk timers is rather
    stupid. Ton works around it by maintaining separate "immediate" and
    timer queues, and not using Tk to drive the immediate events. I've
    commented on his idea in POE::Loop::TkCommon.

    This commit moves signal deprecations forward. It incorporates a
    number of changes:
    
    POE has stopped dispatching _signal publicly. It's still used
    internally, but programs will not receive it. Attempting to register
    a _signal event handler will still result in a fatal error, however.
    This has the nice benefit of pushing problems on users rather than
    allowing them to fester quietly as bizarre runtime behavior. I'm all
    for that since it's less support problems.
    
    The return values of signal handlers are not significant anymore, and
    you will not receive errors based on them. Using sig_handled() is
    mandatory if you want to handle signals.
    
    POE does not always register handlers for most of %SIG anymore.
    Instead, it registers the handlers as needed when you call
    $kernel->sig(). This means that Ctrl+Z (^Z) WILL suspend any program
    that has not set a TSTP handler.
    
    Signal dispatch is vastly simplified. It should be significantly
    faster, although most programs won't notice a difference. Signal
    dispatch is not that common.
    
    Tests for deprecated behaviors have been removed.
    
    Old emacs-style indenting has been changed to more conventional
    indenting here and there.
    
    The ses_session.pm test sometimes dumps core under Tk. It's not
    consistent, and I'm not sure why.

    These are the wonderful tests we're adding to replace the stinky old
    ones. Some of these are the stinky old ones in new clothes, but just
    for a little while until we can make less stinky ones from them.

  Makefile.PL 1.30; mylib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.43

    Migrate the prompt bypassing code out of the 5.5+ Makefile generator
    and into the base Makefile.PL. This is the code that skips
    interaction if STDIN isn't a terminal, or if --default is specified. 

  2004-09-04 22:19:10 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.103; Makefile.PL 1.29;
  mylib/Makefile-5004.pm 1.25; mylib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.42

    Commit the new tests, the new utilities to support them, and
    necessary changes to the install and distribution scripts. 

  2004-09-04 22:07:06 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.102

    Remove the existing tests to make room for the new ones. 

  2004-09-04 21:49:41 by rcaputo; mylib/coverage.perl 1.13

    Ignore modules within the test directory. Also allow coverage of
    individual files on the command line. Great for one-off coverage
    reports to see where a test program is deficient.

  mylib/Makefile-5004.pm 1.24; mylib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.41

    add ability to opt out of network tests 

  2004-09-02 00:22:43 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.101; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.297

    Renamed POE::Loop::Poll to POE::Loop::IO-Poll, to normalize the way
    event loops are loaded. No exceptions for modules that begin with
    IO:: now. 

  2004-09-01 17:41:08 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.296

    Tweaked the POE::Loop loader to load things like Event::Lib as
    POE::Loop::Event-Lib instead of POE::Loop::Lib. It still strips a
    leading IO:: off the path for legacy (POE::Loop::Poll) support. At
    some point we should probably have SourceForge move Poll.pm to
    IO-Poll.pm and remove the IO stripping code. 

  2004-09-01 16:35:08 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm 1.33

    Nick Williams fixed a bug where pressing Return (^M) from within a
    history search would insert the ^M character into the input line
    before returning it. 

  2004-09-01 11:47:47 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm 1.32

    Nick Williams made extensive revisions to this wheel, adding most
    (all?) of the gnu readline features. Command history search, custom
    key bindings, .inputrc parsing, tab completion, vi and emacs modes,
    it's all there!
