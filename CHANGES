    Rethrow exceptions that occur during call().

    The previous exceptions revamp ate exceptions that occurred during
    call(). Chris Williams spotted this happening in tests for
    POE::Component::Client::DNS.

    Fix a "Kernel has child processes" warning even when it doesn't.

    Michel Schrameck reported that the above warning was coming from a
    very simple, obviously not fork()ing test program. I was able to
    reproduce the problem with the test case when USE_SIGCHLD was turned
    off. This fix changes the way first polling of SIGCHLD happens. It
    passes all known tests, but it may negatively affect older programs.
    Please report any problems.

    !!! CATCH_EXCEPTIONS revamp.

    May be slightly backwards incompatible. I expect more good to come
    from it than harm.

    POE should hide error messages less often. Its usage of eval() and
    propagation of exceptions have been simplified somewhat.

    !!! This change reverses POE's stance on user-defined $SIG{__DIE__}
    handlers. Now they are honored inside event handlers. Code that does
    this is expected to know what it's doing. Perl's global special
    variables, including %SIG, have spooky action at a distance.

    Modifying $SIG{__DIE__} locally shouldn't cause any problems. The
    original value will be restored at the end of the local scope.

    I changed this because reasons:

    1. Silent side effects suck. Previously, POE would silently overrule
    global changes to $SIG{__DIE__}. This change makes things a little
    more comprehensible.

    2. $SIG{__DIE__} handlers are very useful for logging and debugging.
    Setting them should be permissible.

    3. If CATCH_EXCEPTIONS is on, and $SIG{__DIE__} is redefined in an
    event handler, the programmer is told about the potential side
    effects. This is an experimental warning and is subject to change
    more than most things.

    4. Error messages were being hidden at work, and it was confounding
    development.

    Refactor _dispatch_event(), extracting _dispatch_signal_event().

    _dispatch_event() was rather large, and there was an isolated section
    for recursive signal dispatch. That has been extracted into its own
    method, _dispatch_signal_event() so the basic event dispatcher can be
    smaller and more focused. This should make it easier to improve
    exception handling in _dispatch_event().

    Make _trap(), _warn(), etc. a little more consistent.

    Put the process ID at the start of every line of error messages,
    rather than just the beginning of the first line. We deal with
    subprocesses a lot at work, and this helps tease apart interleaved
    messages.

    Fail better if asked to serialize a non-reference.

    A component was trying to serialize undef() rather than a reference
    to something undefined. It was causing failure attributed to this
    filter, rather than the user. Now there's a stack trace to help
    spread the blame.

    (more dead code checking is needed). Add leading underscores to the
    private ones.

    It's currently experimental, and it currently breaks other event
    queue nimplementations, so it has to go. Making it private will

    coverage tests pass.

    Move the signal information out of the signal pipe.

    The signal pipe included all signal information. This reduces the
    number of signals that can be dispatched in a single event loop
    iteration. It also limits the amount and/or type of information we
    can include in the signal.

    This change puts the signal information in a plain Perl list and only
    uses the signal pipe to wake up the event loop to dispatch the
    signals in a safer place.

    Consistently stat file names or handles.

    stat() on Windows reports different device IDs for a file depending
    whether it was stat()ed via name or opened handle. If used
    inconsistently, stat() will always report differences. Discovered by

    Fix iThread-safety issue in POE::Component docs.

    Stringified object references aren't iThread-safe. Spawn a new
    interpreter, and copies of object have different memory addresses.
    Previously stringified versions are not fixed to match. Thanks to
    Paul Evans for pointing it out.

    Note how to get ClosedEvent when killing processes in Windows.

    Rafael Kitover provided a test case where kill() would prevent
    ClosedEvent from firing on Winodws. We worked out a work-around,
    which he'll be using in MooseX::Workers. I've documented it here for
    others.

    Don't bother with IO::Tty on Cygwin.

    average_drifter on freenode #perl-cats pointed out that IO::Tty fails
    to install on contemporary Cygwin. This change skips that requirement
    when $^O eq 'cygwin'.

    After investigating, I found and reported two problems. These must be
    resolved before undoing this work-around:

    IO::Tty compile failure:

    App::cpanminus conrigure timeout is too short:

    Don't confess on the use of AF_INET6 or PF_INET6 in SocketFactory.

    SocketFactory uses those constants unconditionally during
    initialization, so things that don't even need them fail.

    22a531 is a Perl 5.6.2 test failure, but as far as I can tell all the
    errors are due to missing IPv6 support on that platform.

    Greg Sabino Mullane pointed out the difficulty of finding a complete,
    up to date change log. The CHANGES file distributed with POE only
    goes back a year, and he needed to go farther back.

    Docment that waitpid() calls interfere with sig_child().

    Programs that reap their own child processes AND use sig_child() to
    watch for those processes MUST call sig_child($pid, undef) to clear
    the watchers. sig_child() only notifies programs after some event
    loop reaps the process. If an application reaps it first, POE may
    never know the child went away.
