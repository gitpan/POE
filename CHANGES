	* POE.pm: Increase the version number to 0.21.

2002-06-18 22:18  rcaputo

	* POE/Component/: Client/TCP.pm, Server/TCP.pm: (!!!) Change the
	ClientFilter and Filter parameters in Server::TCP and Client::TCP
	respectively.  They were recently "enhanced" to accept filter
	instances, and they would create filter instances from class names
	internally.  However, this new "feature" meant that every
	connection SHARED THE SAME FILTER.  The changes now let them accept
	class names and optional constructor parameters, and the components
	will instantiate new filters for each connection.  "MarkClone" on
	efnet reported that the POE Cookbook web server was only honoring
	its first request; the remainders were bombing out with an error
	which led me to this problem.

2002-06-18 22:13  rcaputo

	* POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm: Extend the description of
	SuccessEvent's INET address field.  This is in response to Jos
	Boumans' question about it.

2002-06-18 21:59  rcaputo

	* POE/Filter/HTTPD.pm: Prettied up the error dump some more.

2002-06-18 21:23  rcaputo

	* POE/Filter/HTTPD.pm: Justify the offsets in error dumps so things
	line up better.

2002-06-18 21:21  rcaputo

	* POE/Filter/HTTPD.pm: When the HTTP parser writes a hex dump, make
	it use a fixed font so things line up.

2002-06-13 23:49  rcaputo

	* POE/Preprocessor.pm: Update the instructions for using
	POE::Processor with PerlApp.  Thanks to Zoltan Kandi for making
	sure it works.

2002-06-11 17:02  rcaputo

	* NEEDS: Peter Chen noticed that the NEEDS file did not list
	Storable as one of POE::Filter::Reference's dependencies.  Now it
	does. :)

2002-06-10 17:53  rcaputo

	* t/00_coverage.t: This test never called POE::Kernel's run()
	method, so we got a warning about that.  Now it's all better.

2002-06-10 17:47  rcaputo

	* POE/Kernel.pm: feelicks had a problem where his program never
	ran.  It was traced back to not calling $poe_kernel->run().  This
	happens to me ALL THE TIME, and feelicks (and I) is sure it happens
	to a lot of people.  I added a flag that's set when run() is
	called.  POE::Kernel's DESTROY will warn the programmer/operator if
	that flag is not set.

2002-06-09 18:32  rcaputo

	* lib/: Makefile-5004.pm, Makefile-5005.pm: Fix the cvs2cl
	invocations so they really include CHANGES files in tarballs.  The
	order of operations in "make dist" means that PREOP occurs AFTER
	CHANGES is copied into the tarball tree.  D'oh!

2002-06-08 03:29  rcaputo

	* POE.pm, README: Final preparations for releasing POE 0.20.

2002-06-08 03:26  rcaputo

	* CHANGES: Version 0.20 and beyond use auto-generated CHANGES files
	based on POE's cvs log.

2002-06-08 01:58  rcaputo

	* lib/: Makefile-5004.pm, Makefile-5005.pm: Have Makefile.PL touch
	the CHANGES file so that "make dist" will find it.  Even though we
	generate CHANGES from the CVS log, WriteMakeFile needs to see
	something there first.

2002-06-07 04:17  rcaputo

	* lib/Makefile-5004.pm: Perl 5.004_03 didn't like AUTHOR and
	ABSTRACT, so I removed them.

2002-06-07 04:14  rcaputo

	* lib/Makefile-5005.pm: Perl 5.005_03 didn't like bareword IO::Poll
	on the left side of the => operator.  I put quotes around it, and
	things seem to be generally better.

2002-06-07 04:13  rcaputo

	* POE/Kernel/Tk.pm, t/06_tk.t: Philip Gwyn discovered a
	"modification of a read-only value" error in POE::Kernel::Tk's file
	watcher pause/resume code.  I adapted a previous plain-Tk testcase
	to verify the behavior outside POE.  It's there in Tk on Perl
	5.004_05.  The testcase doesn't fail with Perl 5.005_03, so it
	looks like an incompatibility between Tk and the older version of
	Perl.  I've decided to discontinue Tk support in Perl versions
	before 5.005_03.  If anyone has a vested interest in the older
	Perls + Tk + POE, I can provide the test case for their debugging
	pleasure.

2002-06-06 05:19  rcaputo

	* t/27_poll.t: Philip Gwyn spotted that TestSetup wasn't being used
	here.  That's what I get for testing stuff on systems that have
	everything.

2002-06-03 15:34  rcaputo

	* lib/: Makefile-5005.pm, Makefile-5004.pm: Added the second bit of
	sungo's Makefile magic.  This part generates POE's CHANGES
	automatically from the cvs log.  No more twiddling with it by hand!
	 Yay!  P.S., Everybody better commit decent change descriptions, or
	else.

2002-06-03 04:46  rcaputo

	* lib/Makefile-5005.pm: Remove IPC::Run (we're not using it yet).

2002-06-02 16:03  rcaputo

	* CHANGES, POE.pm: Bump version number to 0.1901

2002-06-02 16:02  rcaputo

	* POE/Preprocessor.pm: Fixed a missing symbol warning when expanded
	source dumping is off.

2002-06-01 22:13  rcaputo

	* lib/Makefile-5005.pm: Disable t/27_poll.t if IO::Poll is not
	installed.

2002-06-01 22:13  rcaputo

	* t/00_coverage.t: Prettified another message pertaining to a
	missing optional dependency.  Made an old one more cleare (gods, I
	hope) about the missing module being optional.

2002-06-01 22:12  rcaputo

	* CHANGES, POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm: Jos Boumans discovered some
	segfault-like behavior when using POE::Wheel::ReadLine on MSWin32. 
	ActiveState Perl does not gracefully handle BEGIN{eval{}}, so the
	BEGIN{} parts were successfully removed.

2002-06-01 22:08  rcaputo

	* POE/Kernel/Poll.pm: Increased the amount of debugging information
	when TRACE_SELECT is enabled.  Part of the effort to make IO::Poll
	work on MSWin32.

2002-06-01 22:06  rcaputo

	* POE/Kernel.pm: Fixed the bug Ted Suzman reported on MSWin32 (re:
	SIGCHLD returning positive PIDs).  Worked around the fact that
	IO::Poll is broken (or at least behaving inconsistent with its
	documentation) on MSWin32.

2002-06-01 22:04  rcaputo

	* CHANGES, MANIFEST, t/28_windows.t: Properly attributed Matt
	Sergeant (not Scott Beck) for IO::Poll support.  Fixed the bug that
	Ted Suzman reported in Kernel.pm's SIGCHLD handling.  True
	processes return positive PIDs, which were being treated as
	inconsistencies in POE::Kernel.  Added a regression test for this
	condition.

2002-05-30 06:40  rcaputo

	* CHANGES, MANIFEST, POE.pm, POE/Kernel.pm, POE/Kernel/Poll.pm,
	lib/Makefile-5005.pm, t/08_errors.t, t/27_poll.t: Matt Sergeant
	contributed POE::Kernel::Poll, an event loop substrate based on
	IO::Poll.  IO::Poll is potentially faster than select() in large
	scale servers (and other multi-connection programs).  I also
	tweaked a description in the 5005 Makefile so the intent of some
	modules is more clear.	Test 27_poll.t is neat, and I'm glad that
	it works.  It reruns test 04_selects.t with IO::Poll loaded,
	forcing POE::Kernel::Poll to be used instead of
	POE::Kernel::Select.

2002-05-30 06:29  rcaputo

	* t/12_signals_ev.t: Try to make the skip message so friendly that
	Windows users don't wonder whether they should install Event.pm.

2002-05-29 05:29  rcaputo

	* CHANGES: Document changes.

2002-05-29 05:27  rcaputo

	* POE/Preprocessor.pm: Added the ability to dump files with
	expanded macros.  This should let perlapp and perl2exe "compile"
	POE programs now.

2002-05-29 05:25  rcaputo

	* POE/Kernel.pm: Moved C<use POE::Preprocessor;> to the top of
	C<package POE::Kernel;> so it would see all of the code therein. 
	The "# include" directives are incompatible with the new
	POE::Preprocessor dump feature, so I removed them.

2002-05-29 05:24  rcaputo

	* POE/: NFA.pm, Session.pm, Kernel/Event.pm, Kernel/Gtk.pm,
	Kernel/Select.pm, Kernel/Tk.pm, Wheel/ReadLine.pm: Moved the C<use
	POE::Preprocessor;> statement to the top of each package it was in.
	 This lets the preprocessor (and the resulting expanded files)
	include everything in the package.

2002-05-28 22:53  rcaputo

	* POE/Kernel.pm: Applied some of the feedback from Android18, errr,
	and hdm on #poe.  These are minor doc patches to clarify some finer
	points.

2002-05-28 22:49  rcaputo

	* CHANGES, POE/Wheel/Run.pm, t/08_errors.t: I patched
	POE::Wheel::Run to use POE::Filter::Line by default.  This broke a
	subtest in t/08_errors.t when previously illegal usage became okay.
	 Heh!

2002-05-28 22:46  rcaputo

	* CHANGES, POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm: My previous "fixes" for
	FollowTail weren't very good.  This set of fixes seems to work much
	better in tests.  The problem?	Not properly detecting when log
	files were reset.  In the process of fixing it, more debugging
	information was added, and the BUGS were updated.

2002-05-28 02:01  rcaputo

	* t/08_errors.t: Skipped more Wheel::Run based tests.

2002-05-28 02:00  rcaputo

	* t/04_selects.t: The new select bug test failed on Win32 because
	it assumed select() and non-blocking I/O worked on plain files. 
	Fixed it to use a socket instead, which Windows can cope with.

2002-05-28 01:59  rcaputo

	* t/: 01_sessions.t, 22_wheel_run.t: Make the Win32 skip messages a
	little friendlier.

2002-05-27 21:53  rcaputo

	* lib/Makefile-5005.pm: Re-revised the module categories.  I know
	it's silly to think there ever will be a wording that will satisfy
	everyone, but still I try. :)

2002-05-27 21:52  rcaputo

	* CHANGES, POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm: ReadLine now assumes vt100 if a
	TERM environment variable isn't set.

2002-05-27 21:49  rcaputo

	* POE/Filter/Reference.pm: Document how easy it is to use YAML with
	Filter::Reference.  Damn, that's sexy.

2002-05-27 21:48  rcaputo

	* POE/Component/: Client/TCP.pm, Server/TCP.pm: Standardized the
	semantics of Filter and ClientFilter.  Both may now take a
	POE::Filter class instance or name.  For class names, they try
	building a standard (no parameters) instance of the class
	internally.

2002-05-27 21:36  rcaputo

	* POE/Session.pm: Fixed a typo that Kane found in the docs.

2002-05-27 02:35  rcaputo

	* lib/Makefile-5005.pm: ttyS on IRC was confused about the
	"Optional Full-Screen Child Process Support" message, so I revised
	them all to be a little less dense.

2002-05-25 19:45  rcaputo

	* CHANGES, POE/Kernel.pm, t/04_selects.t: Scott Beck discovered a
	long-standing (but rarely, if ever heretofore tickled) bug in
	POE::Kernel's _internal_select().  I tracked it down to a leftover
	hash key that wasn't removed when necessary.  POE::Kernel now
	deletes it, and t/04_selects.t has a new test.

2002-05-24 21:00  rcaputo

	* POE/Wheel/Run.pm, t/22_wheel_run.t: After spending several days
	beating my head against the fork/exec paradigm on Win32, I have
	finally concluded that it is not consistently implemented from one
	Windows version to the next, making it a veritable nightmare of
	twisty variations to work around.  Neither IPC::Open2, IPC::Open3,
	nor IPC::Run work across the myriad flavors of "Win32", and I have
	neither the time nor inclination to attempt success where three
	such modules-- all dedicated to performing this very task, and it
	alone-- have failed.  Arf fthagn poit!	(Anyone who does have the
	time or inclination to fix it is welcome to, though.)

2002-05-24 20:55  rcaputo

	* lib/Makefile-5005.pm: Increase the required version for
	ExtUtils::AutoInstall.

2002-05-23 12:45  rcaputo

	* CHANGES, POE/Wheel/Run.pm, t/22_wheel_run.t: Added ARG4 to
	Wheel::Run's ErrorEvent.  This extra parameter indicates the child
	filehandle that generated the error.  For example, "read" error "0"
	on "STDOUT" means that the child's STDOUT was closed.  I also
	updated the Wheel::Run test to use CloseEvent instead of signals to
	detect when a child was done.

2002-05-22 22:38  rcaputo

	* CHANGES, POE/Wheel/Run.pm: I added CloseEvent to Wheel::Run. 
	This should address a long-standing issue where it was difficult to
	tell when child processes were done sending information.

2002-05-22 19:06  rcaputo

	* POE/Driver/SysRW.pm: Remove a spurious $|=1 leftover from
	testing.

2002-05-22 18:48  rcaputo

	* POE/: NFA.pm, Session.pm: Differentiate between package and
	object methods in an error message.

2002-05-22 01:41  rcaputo

	* POE/Kernel.pm: Made some of the TRACE_SELECT warnings a little
	more descriptive.

2002-05-21 23:02  rcaputo

	* MANIFEST, lib/AutoInstall.pm, lib/Makefile-5005.pm,
	lib/ExtUtils/AutoInstall.pm: Moved ExtUtils::AutoInstall to a
	location where it may be found with a simple "use" statement.  Also
	upgraded it to 0.32.

2002-05-21 22:58  rcaputo

	* t/09_wheels_unix.t: Make the "Windows don't do dat!" message a
	little more professional.

2002-05-21 22:51  rcaputo

	* CHANGES, t/06_tk.t: I confirmed that Tk's fileevent watchers are
	broken on Win32.  POE's Tk I/O tests fail without any reads, and
	the test is being run under Win32, assume that the installed Tk is
	a broken one.  In that case, skip the tests rather than fail them. 
	For all other situations (including working Tk on Win32), the tests
	should behave normally.

2002-05-21 02:26  rcaputo

	* CHANGES, POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm: While writing a sample program
	for POE's cookbook, I found that POE::Wheel::FollowTail would
	detect log resets even when none happened.  I revised the way log
	file resets are detected, and it seems to work much better now.

2002-05-20 19:18  rcaputo

	* POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm: Ekkis found a system where
	POSIX::Termios::getospeed() on STDIN returned undef.  Default the
	terminal output speed to 38400 in this case.

2002-05-19 02:52  rcaputo

	* lib/Makefile-5005.pm: 
	Fixed the filename in the auto-generated CHANGES magic.  That's
	still commented out, though.  "make dist" will fail if CHANGES
	isn't there already; this is because it's in MANIFEST, and the
	Makefile won't build an incomplete tarball.  Added a bit of code to
	touch the CHANGES file so it always exists after "perl
	Makefile.PL".  That's also commented out for now.

2002-05-18 04:11  rcaputo

	* CHANGES: Clean out the non-changes bits in preparation for a time
	when CHANGES will be auto-generated.  Oh, and document the other
	changes.

2002-05-18 04:10  rcaputo

	* lib/Makefile-5005.pm: Thanks to sungo, I was able to add magic to
	automatically generate CHANGES from the cvs log.  Requires a local
	copy of cvs2cl.pl.  The magic is commented out, however.  We'll be
	hand-rolling CHANGES through the next release since there's already
	much custom change doc lovin' going on there.

2002-05-18 03:59  rcaputo

	* POE/Driver/SysRW.pm: Peter Barabas was going through POE's source
	and uncovered a logic anomaly :) in Driver::SysRW.  I made the
	logic clearer and hopefully more correct, and I documented a
	strangeness between what's expected of sysread() and what actually
	happens.

2002-05-17 01:34  sungo

	* lib/Makefile-5005.pm: default the gtk/tk/event tests to not
	installing all their deps

2002-05-17 01:32  sungo

	* Makefile.PL: drop the spurious warn from the makefile

2002-05-15 18:21  rcaputo

	* Makefile.PL: Tone down the old-Perl warning.	POE hasn't
	deprecated 5.004 just yet.

2002-05-15 17:44  rcaputo

	* CHANGES: Document changes.

2002-05-15 17:44  rcaputo

	* Makefile.PL: Change the deprecation warning back to pre-5.005_03.
	 It was at pre-5.005_05 for testing.

2002-05-15 17:38  rcaputo

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, lib/AutoInstall.pm, lib/Makefile-5004.pm,
	lib/Makefile-5005.pm: Added sungo's makefile magic.

2002-05-15 17:34  rcaputo

	* POE/Wheel/Run.pm, t/08_errors.t, t/11_signals_poe.t,
	t/12_signals_ev.t, t/22_wheel_run.t, t/23_nfa.t: Various
	work-arounds for fork() not being supported under MacOS 9.x.

2002-05-11 12:52  rcaputo

	* POE/Kernel.pm, POE/Session.pm, samples/tk.perl: Deprecate _signal
	event, and by association using _default to handle signals.

2002-05-10 12:14  rcaputo

	* POE/Kernel.pm: Alter ssid macro so it won't expand in a comment.

2002-05-10 01:45  rcaputo

	* CHANGES: Document changes. :)

2002-05-10 01:42  rcaputo

	* POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm: Removed use of deprecated
	SuccessState and FailureState.	Made them SuccessEvent and
	FailureEvent instead.

2002-05-10 01:41  rcaputo

	* t/: 01_sessions.t, 02_alarms.t, 03_aliases.t, 07_event.t: Remove
	implicit signal handling from the tests.

2002-05-10 01:40  rcaputo

	* lib/deptest.perl: Remove mandatory tracing on Solaris since
	nobody has reported the problem it was supposed to help track down
	for a while.

2002-05-10 01:39  rcaputo

	* POE/Wheel/: FollowTail.pm, ListenAccept.pm, ReadWrite.pm,
	SocketFactory.pm: Begin the next phase of FooState parameter
	deprecation in the POE wheels.	Now any use of FooState causes a
	carp.

2002-05-10 01:36  rcaputo

	* POE/Kernel.pm: Make TRACE_ and ASSERT_FOO output more friendly.
	
	Add sig_handled() and set things in motion for implicit signal
	handling deprecations.
	
	Document sig_handled() and finish documenting the changed signal
	handling semantics.

2002-04-12 21:08  rcaputo

	* CHANGES: Document three-phase signal dispatch change.

2002-04-12 21:06  rcaputo

	* t/25_detach.t: Sessions just happened to be destroyed in the
	proper order for the test to succeed, however, the order depeneded
	on the position of code and memory use patterns.  Altering signal
	dispatch changed the way memory was used (and sessions were
	destroyed), uncovering the problem.  Revised the test to prevent
	nondeterministic session destruction from causing future problems.

2002-04-12 21:04  rcaputo

	* t/22_wheel_run.t: Add debugging information so that signal
	dispatch could be monitored.  This is part of the three-phase
	signal dispatch changes.

2002-04-12 21:03  rcaputo

	* t/08_errors.t: Three-phase signal dispatch added new constants to
	POE::Kernel.  Clean those constants out of the package between
	error tests.

2002-04-12 21:02  rcaputo

	* POE/Kernel.pm: Implement three-phase signal dispatch.

2002-03-26 00:23  rcaputo

	* CHANGES, POE.pm: Increase version to 0.19

2002-03-26 00:20  rcaputo

	* CHANGES, lib/deptest.perl: Add blib and blib/lib to
	lib/deptest.perl, making it more useful for other modules.

2002-03-05 00:07  rcaputo

	* CHANGES: Document changes.

2002-03-05 00:06  rcaputo

	* POE/Kernel.pm: Tweak the language in a comment.  Nothing
	functional has changed.

2002-03-05 00:02  rcaputo

	* t/22_wheel_run.t: A half-hearted attempt at getting the test
	working on Win32.

2002-03-04 23:59  rcaputo

	* POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm: Rocco found and fixed a circular reference
	that prevented it (and thus programs) from exeting cleanly.

2002-03-04 23:56  rcaputo

	* POE/Wheel/Curses.pm: Turn blocking back on for STDIN, or some
	curses libraries won't properly refresh the display.

2002-03-04 23:52  rcaputo

	* POE/: Pipe.pm, Pipe/OneWay.pm, Pipe/TwoWay.pm: Apply TonyC's
	suggestion for improved Win32 compatibility.

2002-03-04 23:46  rcaputo

	* POE.pm: Updated Windows and MacOS support info. in POE's man
	page.

2002-02-25 21:45  rcaputo

	* CHANGES, POE/Kernel.pm: Wrap binmode() in eval so that it won't
	die if a tied filehandle doesn't support it.  Don't call fcntl() on
	tied filehandles because that leads to death also.

2002-02-25 06:02  rcaputo

	* CHANGES, POE/Kernel.pm, POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm: Wrap
	binmode() in eval{} because tied filehandle classes may die in it
	or fail to implement it altogether.  Both of those conditions will
	cause a fatal runtime error.

2002-02-17 19:06  rcaputo

	* CHANGES: Document changes. :)

2002-02-17 19:05  rcaputo

	* POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm: Made ReadLine use a private copy of STDIN
	and STDOUT so that redirecting them won't interfere with the
	console.

2002-02-17 19:03  rcaputo

	* POE/NFA.pm: Add CALLER_FILE and CALLER_LINE parameters.  Add a
	get_runstate() method to fetch a machine's HEAP-like substance.

2002-02-05 01:31  rcaputo

	* POE/Session.pm: Remove a blank line.

2002-02-05 01:31  rcaputo

	* POE/Kernel.pm: Remove some deadwood.	Apply a typo fix that Sungo
	spotted.

2002-01-25 04:33  rcaputo

	* CHANGES: Document changes.

2002-01-25 04:26  rcaputo

	* POE/Kernel.pm: Redocument internal data structures.

	ReadLine.pm, ReadWrite.pm, Run.pm, SocketFactory.pm: Replace $self
	as the unique identifier in Wheel/*.pm.  Instead it's the wheel's
	unique ID from Wheel::allocate_unique_id().  Since I/O events are

	all dispatched and create a new one with the exact same reference. 
	The new wheel would receive an event for the old one.  Unique IDs
	prevent this.

2001-07-25 16:26  rcaputo

	* POE/: NFA.pm, Session.pm: Revert const and enum constants back to
	Perl constant subs.  Profiling and coverage testing will be slower
	(and maybe less accurate), but this is a necessary step towards a
	POE::Session::Base class and inheritable session types.

2001-07-25 15:52  rcaputo

2001-07-25 15:50  rcaputo

	* POE/Wheel/Run.pm: Wrap getpriority() and setpriority() calls in
	an eval block so they don't kill programs running where those
	syscalls aren't supported.  Namely Windows.

2001-07-25 15:29  rcaputo

	* POE/Pipe/: OneWay.pm, TwoWay.pm: socketpair() doesn't seem to do
	the right thing for Windows systems; force pipes to use
	IO::Socket::INET instead on Windows

2001-07-25 15:28  rcaputo

	* POE/Preprocessor.pm: Enhance runtime error messages so they show
	the absolute line number in the macro definition file where the
	error occurs.  Developers should be able to jump to that line in
	the file and reach the offending code.

2001-07-25 15:26  rcaputo

	* README: add Windows testing information

2001-07-24 20:16  rcaputo

	need to match Session's

	10_wheels_tcp.t, 14_wheels_ft.t, 20_accept.t, 22_wheel_run.t,
	23_nfa.t, 25_detach.t: fix tests so Kernel::ASSERT_DEFAULT doesn't
	cause missing state warnings.  I'd used missing states on purpose,
	and now they're noisy!

2001-07-18 18:42  rcaputo

	* POE/Kernel.pm: comment and documentation tweaks; no new
	functionality

2001-07-18 18:41  rcaputo
