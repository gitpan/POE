  2006-01-29 15:45:38 by rcaputo; lib/POE.pm 1.199

    Bump up the version for a bugfix. 

  2006-01-26 05:59:50 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.72

    Fixed a really dumb error... if (condition) { ... } else { do_stuff()
    if condition } ... d'oh.

    remove superfluous regenerating of dynamic states when changing
    filter. 

  2005-12-29 17:55:36 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.333

    Make TRACE_STATISTICS (and probably others) strict-safe. Thanks, Nick
    Williams, for pointing it out. 

  2005-12-23 08:16:06 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm 1.20

    The end-of-run child process reaper should block if there are
    unreaped processes out there. I mistakenly made the loop
    non-blocking, and now it's fixed.

2005-12-22 22:31:48 v0_33
=========================

  2005-12-22 22:31:48 by rcaputo; mylib/gen-tests.perl 1.9

    Add the ability to skip certain classes of tests on certain
    platforms, then use it to skip the IO::Poll tests on MSWin32. First,
    IO::Poll is kinda broken on MSWin32 and falls back to select()
    anyway. Second, some of the tests break outright in the IO::Poll
    fallback tests. 

  2005-12-22 20:18:29 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm 1.19

    Use the WNOHANG constant rather than the magic 0. Skip child reaping
    on Win32. It seems to cause problems of the "segfault" variety. 

  2005-12-22 17:49:26 by rcaputo
  tests/30_loops/00_base/comp_tcp_concurrent.pm 1.2

    These tests fail under Win32, so I'm skipping them. It seems that
    Win32 socket creation isn't as concurrent as we'd expect, and
    deadlocks occur. 

  2005-12-18 22:45:18 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.332

    Whitespace cleanup. 

  2005-12-18 22:41:17 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.331

    Replace string evals with typeglob tricks to define various
    constants. It weren't exactly broken, but I fixed it anyway.

  tests/10_units/07_exceptions/03_not_handled.t 1.3

    Change exceptions to propagate out and kill the whole process if they
    are unhandled.
    
    All tests pass Debian Linux 2.6.12.3something with perl 5.8.7 

  2005-12-11 02:31:51 by hachi
  tests/90_regression/steinert-recursive-signal.t 1.2

    Better testage for signal recursion causing corruption of the
    bookkeeping values. 

  2005-12-10 07:55:05 by hachi
  tests/10_units/07_exceptions/03_not_handled.t 1.2

    Change exceptions test to better determine if POE has shut down
    properly when the DIE signal is not handled 

  2005-12-10 07:45:08 by hachi
  lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.329; lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm 1.18

    This patch fixes the recursive signal testing added earlier. It uses
    package globals instead of lexicals for the bookkeeping vars in
    POE/Resource/Signals.pm, this should be examined for a faster way if
    possible.
    
    All tests pass Linux Debian x86 

  2005-12-10 07:36:17 by hachi; MANIFEST 1.122

    Forgot to add new test to MANIFEST 

  2005-12-10 06:25:58 by hachi
  tests/90_regression/steinert-recursive-signal.t 1.1

    Welcome to recursive signals, this test makes sure that the
    sig_handled() flag does not affect outer signals during recursive
    dispatch.
    
    This is currently only occuring when a signal handler causes an
    exception, and the DIE signal is called in response to this. This
    test fails on cvspoe currently, patch forthcoming to fix it. 

  2005-12-09 06:12:44 by rcaputo; lib/POE.pm 1.198

    This release is different enough to warrant version 0.33 even though
    we haven't made our stated goals for this release. I'll probably
    break up the milestones in rt.cpan.org and stop trying to adhere to
    specific goals for specific versions. 

  2005-12-05 06:41:30 by rcaputo; lib/POE.pm 1.197

    Version update for release. 

  2005-12-04 06:00:55 by sungo; MANIFEST 1.121; MANIFEST.SKIP 1.10

    update manifest for new tests. apparently the manifest got rearranged
    internally so the diff looks way larger than it really is. add
    run_network_tests file to MANIFEST.SKIP.

  lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.328; lib/POE/Session.pm 1.114

    add documentation for the new exception handling code 

  2005-11-30 06:05:12 by sungo
  lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.327; lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm 1.17

    roll exception handling (ala POE::Exceptions) into the core. this
    patch creates a new terminal signal called DIE. if an exception
    occurs, this signal is sent to the session that caused the exception.
    by the nature of signals, if the child fails to handle the excpetion,
    the signal propogates up the session tree until either someone
    handles the signal or the poe environment collapses. two small tweaks
    were necessary outside of _dispatch_event. session_alloc needed to
    cache the value of _data_alias_loggable, for later logging, and it
    needed to check to see if the new session survived _start and _child
    dispatches. currently this new functionality is undocumented and does
    not have its own unit tests. this oversight will be corrected soon.
    right now, all current tests pass without modification on gentoo
    linux running kernel version 2.6.14 and perl 5.8.7. 

  2005-11-30 02:46:57 by sungo; tests/30_loops/00_base/k_detach.pm 1.4

    change a raft full of ok($string eq "string") tests to is($string,
    "string") for easier test debugging 

  2005-11-26 06:55:31 by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Filter/HTTPD.pm 1.43; tests/10_units/05_filters/03_http.t 1.5

    MSIE bites early and often. In this case, it's sending "\x0D\x0A"
    after Content-Length octets of POST request, which is clearly in
    violation of w3.org statute number mumble. Here we see the intrepid
    Philip Gwyn patch Filter::HTTPD to ignore whitespace after a full
    request. 

  2005-11-21 06:50:35 by hachi; lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm 1.16

    Mandatory warning for reaped processes to pair with sigchld semantics
    changing. This loop will block the Kernel shutdown until all
    processes are reaped. All tests pass. 

  2005-11-21 06:26:51 by hachi
  tests/90_regression/merijn-sigchld-system.t 1.3

    Probably should test after removing the signal watcher again. 

  2005-11-07 06:59:07 by hachi
  lib/POE/Resource/Sessions.pm 1.21; lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm 1.15

    Change signal watchers so they keep sessions alive.
    
    WARNING: This is a major semantics change in POE. It has the
    potential to make code 'hang' in places where it formerly did not.
    
    This change is necessary so sessions expressing an interest in SIG
    CH?LD do not die prematurely. (There is a planned mandatory warning
    for reaped children that were not being watched.) This change fixes
    RT 15215. 

  2005-11-07 06:49:31 by hachi; lib/POE/Loop/PerlSignals.pm 1.11

    Disable use of $SIG{CH?LD} = "IGNORE". This cannot be done in perl
    without breaking system() and friends. This fixes a failing
    tests/90_regression/merijn-sigchld-system.t 

  2005-11-07 04:21:07 by apocal; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.326

    Updated to check for number of sessions in run() and skip the event
    loop if sessions == 0 

  2005-10-22 08:34:44 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.325

    Resolved a conflict between two event types. The recursive signal
    type shared a value with a statistics gathering event type. Now they
    don't overlap. 

  2005-10-19 18:27:18 by hachi
  tests/90_regression/rt1648-tied-stderr.t 1.4

    We need to watch for the child process ending in this test so we are
    a good example for the rest of people, and to avoid a mandatory
    warning that may be added in a near-future revision of POE. 

  2005-10-14 17:47:27 by rcaputo; MANIFEST.SKIP 1.9

    Toy around with the idea of auto-generating MANIFEST at distribution
    time. I'm not satisfied with the opt-out nature of MANIFEST.SKIP.
    It's too easy to create a temporary file and forget to add it to the
    skip file. Next thing I know, crap's being distributed in the
    tarball. Possibly proprietary crap. I can't have that. 

  2005-10-14 17:26:19 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.120

    Add Jonathan Steinert's test to the MANIFEST. 

  2005-10-14 16:15:38 by hachi
  tests/90_regression/merijn-sigchld-system.t 1.2

    Start making this test more portable, someone please suggest
    something I can use on Windows 

  2005-10-14 15:21:16 by hachi
  tests/90_regression/merijn-sigchld-system.t 1.1

    SIGCHLD bug reported by Merijn Broeren on October 13 2005 on the
    mailing list. This test evokes the proper results for me (failure on
    new POE, success on old POE) on Linux 2.6, should be portable but I'm
    not positive. 

  2005-10-05 21:58:46 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Loop.pm 1.8

    "Elly" in IRC suggested that the POE::Loop documentation explicitly
    point out that POE::Loop classes aren't used directly. And that the
    DESCRIPTION point to more detail about how the loops are actually
    used. So here's a fix for that.

  2005-09-08 01:59:33 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.57

    Philip Gwyn discovered a slight problem with his previous patch.
    Increasing the concurrency limit wouldn't resume the listener. This
    applies his fix.

    Philip Gwyn added a Concurrency parameter to PoCo::Server::TCP. It
    limits the number of concurrent connections the server can handle. 

  2005-09-07 04:25:37 by rcaputo; tests/30_loops/00_base/comp_tcp.pm 1.3

    Removed a delete() that was used to close a connection. Server::TCP
    doesn't require such heavy-handed methods anymore.

  lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.323; lib/POE/Loop/Select.pm 1.59

    Abhishek Jain discovered a heretofore obscure socket leakage issue in
    POE::Component::Server::TCP. New connection sockets were passed into
    callbacks as closures, preventing them from being closed timely on
    shutdown unless a session also exited. This commit fixes the problem
    by passing new connections through POE::Session's args parameter
    rather than tying them up in closures. 

  2005-08-10 14:44:08 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.322

    Invoke event handlers in void context if the dispatcher is called in
    void context. Previously handlers would be called in scalar context,
    causing a subtle edge case where objects wouldn't destruct properly. 

  2005-08-10 14:28:16 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm 1.38

  tests/90_regression/averell-callback-ret.t 1.1

    Averell pointed out that callbacks via POE::Session->callback() do
    not return their handlers' return values to the caller. This is
    directly contraindicated by the comments. Furthermore, and perhaps
    best, he submitted a small patch to fix it and a proper regression
    test. His report was 100% perfect in all regards (even if his patch
    was a little overzealous). Be like him. 

  2005-07-04 20:32:55 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Session.pm 1.112

    Shorten and sweeten the documentation for postback() and callback().

    Apply Merijn Broeren's patch to SocketFactory for ActiveState Perl.
    This improves the non-blocking connect code by not turning
    non-blocking on for ALL sockets created in a process. NBIO is only
    turned on for the ones created by the socket factory.

    Work around Cygwin quirks in the tests. 1. syswrite() blocks on
    non-blocking pipes, so I moved a test over to internet domain
    sockets. 2. close() on non-blocking sockets writes, so I changed a
    test to use shutdown() instead. 3. Files appear to be opened for
    exclusive access by default, so the Wheel::FollowTail tests can't
    run. This closes rt.cpan.org tickets 11553 and 11053.

    Arturas Slajus (with diacriticals, however) reported a bug in POE's
    signal handling (rt.cpan.org ticket 12953). This turned out to be
    caused by calling sig() outside a running session. This change checks
    that methods requiring to be called from running sessions actually
    are, but it only does so when ASSERT_USAGE is enabled.

    Lift POE::Filter::Reference's get() to POE::Filter, and modify most
    of the other POE::Filter subclasses to use it. POE::Filter::HTTPD is
    an exception because it doesnt' have a get_one() function.
    POE::Filter::Stackable's get_one() was rewritten to accommodate the
    change. 

  2005-06-29 02:49:34 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Session.pm 1.111

    Add a mandatory carp() to POE::Session->new() per rt.cpan.org ticket

    Fix tab damage I introduced in the last patch to Filter::Reference. 

  2005-06-27 04:32:59 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Filter/Reference.pm 1.36

    Modify get_one() to not destroy the reference's header in the buffer,
    in case it's a partial read and we switch the filter to something
    else. In the past, the reference's header would be lost.

    Make the POE::Filter::* classes inherit from POE::Filter despite that

    isa() to determine whether things are POE::Filter classes. Closes
    rt.cpan.org ticket #13146.
    
    Cleaned up the syntax somewhat in a few of the files.
    
    I removed a huge chunk of redundant code in POE::Filter::Reference by
    rewriting get() in terms of get_one_start() and get_one(). All tests
    pass. 

  2005-05-30 08:32:56 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.320

    Remove the unused ET_SIGNAL_COMPATIBLE and rename the explicit

    cleans up some vestiges from the signal deprecations. 

  2005-05-30 02:22:49 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.115

    The last two regression tests won't do much good if they aren't in
    the distribution. 

  2005-05-30 02:21:53 by rcaputo
  tests/90_regression/steinert-signal-integrity.t 1.1

    Add a regression test to ensure recursive signal dispatch doesn't
    clobber signal parameters. 

  2005-05-30 02:20:34 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.319

    Put Jonathan Steinert's patch back. Fix recursive signal dispatch to
    use copies of @$etc rather than the original in nested
    _dispatch_event calls. Any future recursive _dispatch_event calls
    will probably need to do the same. 

  2005-05-29 06:13:34 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.318

    Expose and document the new select() methods' arguments pass-through
    parameters.
    
    Modify Jonathan Steinert's @$etc clearing to preserve $_[ARG0] for
    signal events. Recursive dispatch code really needs that. I suspect
    that SIGCHLD dispatch is still broken, as many of the parameters
    passed down to it will be wiped out before the event is dispatched
    everywhere. 

  2005-05-29 06:10:49 by rcaputo
  tests/20_resources/00_base/filehandles.pm 1.3

    Modified the test for the internal _data_handle_add()'s new
    pass-through arguments parameter. 

  2005-05-28 23:57:37 by rcaputo
  tests/90_regression/steinert-passed-wheel.t 1.2

    Add an Id tag. D'oh. 

  2005-05-28 23:56:42 by rcaputo
  tests/90_regression/steinert-passed-wheel.t 1.1

    Add a regression test for hachi's last commit. His commit breaks
    something in SIGIDLE/SIGZOMBIE dispatch (k_aliases.t), and I want to
    be sure I fix that without regressing the issue he fixed. 

  2005-05-28 22:45:02 by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.317; lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm 1.20

    Add pass-through parameters to POE::Kernel's select methods. Values
    passed in this way will be passed back with the I/O events they
    generate. 

  2005-05-25 00:54:57 by hachi; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.316

    Arguments to an event should be cleaned up after the event is called,
    but before we return control back to the Kernel (queued events) or
    the calling Session (called events).

    Bump up the version. Dance! Dance! 

  2005-05-18 23:08:17 by rcaputo; tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm 1.8

    Fall back to a single POE::Kernel->run() in this test because
    multiple entries were crashing ActivePerl + Tk. 

  2005-05-17 07:19:20 by rcaputo; tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm 1.7

    Fix a miscount in the number of skipped tests under Windows. Also
    skip all tests when using Event, as it seems that Event +
    thread-simulated fork() + re-entering the event loop = Breakage. 

  2005-05-16 20:53:37 by hachi; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.315

    Minor documentation gap, and some bad grammar. 

  2005-05-16 05:28:55 by rcaputo; mylib/coverage.perl 1.15

    General cleanups during a Devel::Cover debugging session. Be more
    careful about the steps taken. Display some debugging output.
    Explicitly specify an output directory. 

  2005-05-16 04:09:37 by rcaputo; tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm 1.6

    The restructured tests cause one of the sessions to receive a SIGCHLD
    when it doesn't have a wheel. Now we don't try to call a method on
    that nonexistent wheel. 

  2005-05-15 22:20:59 by apocal; lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.53

    Andrew A. Chen reported on the mailinglist that inet_aton wasn't
    imported, thanks! 

  2005-05-15 07:09:44 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Loop/Event.pm 1.43;
  lib/POE/Loop/PerlSignals.pm 1.10; lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm 1.14

    Fix SIGCHLD and SIGPIPE so they are IGNOREd by default. In SIGCHLD's
    case, this means Perl will reap child processes so you don't need to
    register a SIGCHLD handler if you don't care. In SIGPIPE's case, it
    means programs won't die if they mistakenly write to a broken pipe.
    Both situations have occurred since POE stopped setting default
    handlers for these signals. 

  2005-05-15 07:07:16 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Loop/IO_Poll.pm 1.33

    Use better choices for the poll(2) flags when watching filehandles
    for normal (non-expedited/OOB) input and output. Drop the minimum
    poll timeout hack for certain legacy Linux builds (it was 0 anyway). 

  2005-05-15 07:04:51 by rcaputo; tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm 1.5

    Skip the pty tests when IO::Poll or Event are used on Mac OS X. It
    appears that OS X 10.4 has broken poll(2) when used with pseudo-ttys.
    I haven't found a work-around other than to bypass the tests. 

  2005-05-15 07:02:25 by rcaputo;
  tests/10_units/02_pipes/02_oneway.t 1.3;
  tests/10_units/02_pipes/03_twoway.t 1.3

    Moved the POE::Pipe::{One,Two}Way test code out of the
    POE::Wheel::Run tests and into their own files. This shouldn't
    sacrifice coverage since the pipe tests don't use event loops anyway. 

  2005-05-15 07:00:12 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resource/Statistics.pm 1.5

    Fix some cosmetic problems in the end-of-run statistics report. 

  2005-05-15 01:44:12 by hachi
  tests/10_units/03_base/11_assert_usage.t 1.3

    Duplicated test, same test is a couple lines up verbatim. 

  2005-05-14 23:48:12 by hachi; mylib/PoeBuildInfo.pm 1.6

    Fix make distclean so test directories (not just the tests
    themselves) are cleaned up. This helps to stop CVS from screaming at
    you if you've run tests and then want to commit some changes (still
    have to run make distclean, but at least it works.) 

  2005-05-14 20:29:02 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.52

    Clear up the purpose and activities of ClientShutdownOnError, at
    least a little bit. 

  2005-04-29 16:42:30 by rcaputo; tests/30_loops/00_base/k_detach.pm 1.2

    Compensate for machines with variable CPU rates. They cause
    hi-resolution time() to bobble backwards by a few milliseconds eveny
    few seconds. This test requires events to run in a certain order, and
    they don't under those circumstances. It may turn out that we need to
    use a timeless priority queue for FIFO events rather than relying on
    the clock to be monotonic.

    will soon start examining version numbers more strictly. 

  2005-04-24 15:58:40 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.69

    Document that POE::Wheel::Run and POE do not reap child processes

  lib/POE/Loop/TkActiveState.pm 1.8; lib/POE/Loop/TkCommon.pm 1.13

    Enable support for $kernel->run_one_timeslice() under Tk. I had to
    implement loop_do_timeslice() and replace Tk's MainLoop with a custom
    one in loop_run(). I haven't tested this against the memory leak test
    cases in rt.cpan.org, but I'm hoping this code (which is less twisty)
    will solve those issues as well. 

  2005-04-22 20:32:11 by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.68; tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm 1.4

    ActiveState Perl + Tk + POE::Wheel::Run + coderefs = Pain.
    ActiveState Perl emulates fork() with iThreads. Only Perl's core
    exit() will properly "exit" a "process". Tk overrides exit() with its
    own XS magic. This seems to kill off the parent "process". When
    POE::Wheel::Run is used to run subroutines (coderefs) in child
    processes, it must somehow exit() the child process, simulating exec.
    Under Windows, that's Perl's core exit(), which is usurped by Tk,
    which causes ALL MANNER OF EVIL! DON'T GO THERE! WE SURE AREN'T! 

  2005-04-22 20:27:23 by rcaputo; test.pl 1.3

    Apply Ed W's advice regarding non-blocking connect() in ActiveState
    Perl. His advice works in stand-alone (non-POE) tests, and the change
    doesn't break anything in POE's test suite, but I haven't actually
    tested whether non-blocking connect() works under POE now.

    Re-entering Tk::MainLoop too many times, plus signals, seems to
    produce a very deterministic coredump, at least on my current FreeBSD
    perl build. Removed one of three instances of POE::Loop->run(), and
    the crashy-dumpy seems to have gone away.

    Documentation tweaks. Bump the version up to 0.31 for release. 

  2005-04-18 05:03:23 by rcaputo; mylib/gen-tests.perl 1.8

    Replace exit(0) in the test templates with POSIX::_exit(0). Some
    libraries (*cough*Tk*cough*) override Perl's exit(), which seems to
    cause trouble with certain tests' exit values. So even if all the
    tests pass, the FILE fails! Augh! This seems to work around it
    nicely, and it's good mojo on OS X, FreeBSD, and ActivePerl. 

  2005-04-13 15:25:25 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.66

    Replaced {STDIN,STDOUT,STDERR}_FILENO with checks for fileno() in the
    close-on-exec loop we have hand-rolled. I'm hoping the regular
    close-on-exec works similarly and won't close STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR if
    their descriptors happen to be >2. 

  2005-04-13 14:56:30 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.51

    Applied Nick Williams' patch to add Hostname to Server::TCP. This is
    a nonambiguous unpacked hostname or address that will be passed
    through inet_aton(). Useful when your hostnames can be four
    characters long, since they look suspiciously like packed addresses
    to length(). 

  2005-04-13 01:48:23 by rcaputo; mylib/PoeBuildInfo.pm 1.5

    Remove Test::More as a dependency. It has a tendency to want lots of
    other modules. That dependency tree eventually leads to installing a
    new version of Perl. Big can of worms.

    Uhlarik Ond√ej suggested that POE::Wheel::FollowTail should be
    allowed to follow files that don't exist yet. This change adds that
    feature, resolving Uhlarik's rt.cpan.org ticket, number 6048. I hope
    the utf-8 in his name comes through.

    A cheap indent fix. 

  2005-04-12 18:40:07 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.36

    Replace the hardcoded "make" utility with $Config::Config{make} so
    it's "nmake" or a cabbage or something on systems with nonstandard
    build tools. 

  2005-04-12 03:59:17 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Filter/HTTPD.pm 1.40

    This guy named Jack has written a WebDAV server with POE and needs
    Filter::HTTPD not to bomb if the request method isn't GET, HEAD, or
    POST. I've applied a modified version of his patch, resolving RT
    ticket #11821. 

  2005-04-12 02:23:28 by rcaputo; mylib/PoeBuildInfo.pm 1.4

    Add Test::Harness to the dependencies in an effort to solve

    Nick Williams and Merijn Broeren at MSDW did the impossible and
    managed to make POE::Wheel::Run pass actual tests on ActivePerl.
    Damn, they're GOOD! This round of patches isn't 100% perfect (there's
    an issue with the Wheel under POE::Loop::Tk), but I'm confident it'll
    be CPAN-worthy shortly. 

  2005-04-12 01:39:02 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.35

    Part of ExtUtils::AutoInstall's automated install procedure involves
    calling Makefile.PL multiple times with different parameters. This
    was causing the multiple "wanna run network tests?" questions. Now we
    skip the network tests prompt if Makefile.PL is being run again by
    ExtUtils::AutoInstall. 

  2005-03-22 08:04:09 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/ReadWrite.pm 1.71

    Update the code style, but nothing else is changed. This was while

    found/fixed yet. 

  2005-03-22 08:02:51 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.313

    Make the wantarray code in call() more explicit, but don't change the

    Tk::After timers don't use stop(). Rather, they use cancel(). I'm
