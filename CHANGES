    Addressed several of the CPAN testers failures. Releasing a new test
    version to flush out any new issues.

    Simulate a driver get() error by reading from a write-only
    filehandle. I suspect that Perl 5.6.2 is reporting the act of reading
    from a closed fielhandle as an EOF rather than an error, so reading
    from a write-only filehandle may trigger different behavior.

    Looks like Perl 5.8.7 mistreats my @x = $o->method() =~ m//g; as an
    lvalue subroutine motification, or something. Split it into a scalar
    assign, and bind the match to the scalar rather than a method return
    value.

    Contrary to the docs, IO::Pty's clone_winsize_from() seems to die
    noisily if the source filehandle isn't a tty.

    Make SIGDIE asynchronous. It will no longer interrupt long chains of
    events (such as _parent/_child chains during session creation and
    destruction).
    
    Exceptions in _stop is currently untrappable, as the asynchronous
    SIGDIE will have nowhere to be delivered. They will cause POE::Kernel
    to "gracefully" die at the end of _stop's dispatch.
    
    SIGDIE propagation follows the normal rules with one new addition:
    The signal also proragates from the target session upwards through
    parent, grandparent, and so on. It will not be dispatched to children
    of ancestor sessions. It will not be dispatched to POE::Kernel
    itself.
    
    Nearly all regression tests pass. The notable exception is Jonathan
    Steinert's recursive signal tests. They have become moot since SIGDIE
    is not recursive anymore.

    Fixed a pod error that was making pod test fail.
    
    Applied a patch from pravus to fix double InputEvents being triggered
    when tailing an empty file on *BSD.
    
    <+pravus> basically what i am seeing is that if you create a file and
    stat() it before you

    write to it, rdev will be 0. then, once the file is written to, the
    rdev changes. <+pravus> that's causing Wheel::FollowTail to read
    until EOF (getting the line you just wrote),

    reset the file and then re-read (getting the line again).

    According to at least one CPAN tester we cannot assume Storable

    According to the CPAN testers (bless their souls), POE 0.9989 failed
    at least four times due to bind() errors. Mainly addresses already in
    use, which implies some rapid-fire testing. Here I'm patching the
    tests that failed to bind to a random free port rather than hardcoded
    numbers. They should be a lot more resilient to this sort of error.

    Attempt to make the timing more stable in t/30_loops/*/k_alarms.t
    tests. Slow machines, especially running emulators within
    virtualizations, get the time wrong sometimes.

  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Events.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Loop/TkCommon.pm M

    Resolve a CPU spinning issue when using the Tk event loop without any
    event watchers. Resolves ticket 27359 reported by Craig at Lucent.
    Others have also reported this issue, but not in a ticket. :)

  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadWrite.pm M

    Apply Gareth's patch for an optional synchronous put() and a flush()
    method with which to flush the wheel's buffer on command. Resolves
    rt.cpan.org ticket 20328. 

  2007-07-22 06:15:17 (r2198) by rcaputo
  poe/t/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm M

    Add a brief sleep to the child program to allow pipes to be flushed
    before the program exits. Andreas Koenig brought this to my attention
    via CPAN test reports and rt.cpan.org ticket 27478. 

  2007-07-22 02:21:32 (r2197) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Queue/Array.pm M

    Mark Jason Dominus' binary insert example (Higher Order Perl, p. 292)
    inspired me to benchmark POE::Queue::Array against his algorithm. The
    linear seeks become slower after queues of depth 4. They're
    neck-and-neck for shorter ones. POE::Queue::Array's algorithm is a
    little faster otherwise, probably due to the special cases it
    implements.
    
    This patch removes the linear search cases for "small" queues. They
    were not being helpful. It also simplifies the binary search code,
    which is always a plus (Perl runs faster if it runs less code).
    Finally, it simplifies the remaining necessary linear search code...
    but that's after a binary seek anyway.
    
    Net loss: 94 lines of code. All tests still pass.

  poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Resolve rt.cpan.org ticket 27833. Philip Gwyn found a case where the
    connection count for a server could go negative. Not-shutting-down
    hilarity ensues in this case. I've just applied his patch.

  poe/t/30_loops/00_base/wheel_sf_ipv6.pm M

    Eric Hacker found a case where the IPv6 tests failed when AF_INET6
    isn't supplied by Socket6. This commit wraps the use of that constant
    in a block eval and skips all the tests if there's a failure. At
    least I hope that's the case. Should resolve rt.cpan.org ticket
    25879. 

  2007-07-21 06:51:26 (r2194) by rcaputo

    Oops. Remove tabs.

  2007-07-21 06:40:31 (r2193) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm M

    Per STRO's suggestion, test and provide dummies for the IPv6
    constants separately. Resolves rt.cpan.org ticket 27250.

    Yuval Kogman discovered that sig_child() events were not triggering
    after a second POE::Kernel->run() in the same program. We tracked
    this down to a static compile-time initialization. Moving that into
    POE::Resource::Signals::_data_sig_initialize() fixed the problem
    right up.

    Rob Bloodgood found a new deprecation. This change works around it.

    Added handle accessors to Wheel::ReadWrite

  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm M

    Shevek suggested that Fcntl be used to import F_GETFL, F_SETFL and
    O_NONBLOCK since POSIX doesn't always do it. Tests here show that
    using both doesn't throw warnings, so there doesn't seem to be harm
    in it.

  poe/lib/POE/Filter/HTTPD.pm M; poe/t/10_units/05_filters/03_http.t M

    Marlon Bailey discovered that POE::Filter::HTTPD threw incorrect
    objects when methods were of mixed case. Such as "GEt". This commit
    includes a test for the proper behavior and a fix. NB: You'll get
    back an HTTP::Request object with a mixed-case method. The filter
    does NOT force a particular case here.

    I read on perl5-porters this trick to conditionally "use bytes"
    without source filtration. It works! And it's lexical! ZOMG! This
    commit replaces the stinky make-time source filter we were using with
    the compile-time trick. Thanks go out to Phil Harvey for coming up
    with the idea.

    blocking() appears to be a FileHandle method, not an IO::Handle
    method. Use FileHandle explicitly to ensure it's loaded.
