=========================

  2004-06-03 22:10:58 by rcaputo; lib/POE.pm 1.177

    Bump version to 0.29 for release. 

  2004-06-03 22:03:15 by rcaputo; mylib/testreport.pl 1.14

    POE.pm was moved during a recent directory restructuring. The test
    report generator did not know where to find it, so it silently
    reported an empty-versioned POE. This change moves the POE module
    load before tests, and makes it a fatal error if POE can't be loaded.
    It also includes the new library directory, so POE can be loaded.
    This should resolve RT ticket 6143. 

  2004-06-03 18:40:24 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm 1.10

    Improve filehandle tracing while verifying a last minute bug report. 

  2004-06-02 03:36:53 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.286

    This commit localizes $SIG{__DIE__} while loading POE::Resources.
    Suggested by Philip Gwyn on POE's mailing list. 

  2004-06-01 21:26:32 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.285

    Fletch pointed out that POE::Kernel doesn't discuss the POE_*
    environment variables. This commit corrects the omission and revises
    the introduction to POE's assertion and tracing flags.

============================

  2004-05-26 04:45:41 by rcaputo; lib/POE.pm 1.176

    Bump the version for the next release candidate. 

  2004-05-26 03:57:35 by rcaputo; t/30_filter_httpd.t 1.11

    Anonymous Coward reported a bug in the code that skips testing a
    broken HTTP::Request object. This commit should fix it.

============================

  2004-05-24 22:08:23 by rcaputo; lib/POE.pm 1.175

    Bump version to 0.24_06 for another release candidate. 

  2004-05-24 22:07:03 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.284

    Clarify the description of session lifespans when aliases are in
    effect. This is in response to a comment by Matt Cashner. 

  2004-05-24 21:50:25 by rcaputo; mylib/testreport.pl 1.13

    Set the PERL_DL_NONLAZY environment variable for the test report
    generator's harness. I am hoping this will solve some of the
    differences in behavior between "make test" and "make testreport". 

  2004-05-24 21:48:20 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm 1.77

    Specify the address family and socket type to getaddrinfo() calls.
    Whereas they pass on Mac OS X, the calls will fail without these
    parameters on less forgiving systems like FreeBSD. 

  2004-05-24 14:02:08 by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Preprocessor.pm 1.32; lib/POE/Resources.pm 1.9

    Lance Braswell made some specific recommendations for using
    POE::Preprocessor with PerlApp. This commit notes the dynamically
    loaded POE::Resource classes, and it relaxes the error checking for
    missing modules in POE::Resources. 

  2004-05-24 04:34:10 by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm 1.76; t/29_sockfact6.t 1.14

    Migrated the Socket6 code from the deprecated gethostbyname2() to the
    current standard getaddrinfo(). The new call is heavy on
    context-sensitive features, but it combines gethostbyname2() and
    pack_sockaddr_in6() so it's not all bad. Also, Solaris should like
    it, so this closes RT#6191.
    
    Oh, and I made the t/29_sockfact6.t skip messages a little more
    informative.
    
    As usual, CVS is committing touched files along for the ride. It
    doesn't matter that their content hasn't changed.

  mylib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.39; t/30_filter_httpd.t 1.10

    Worked around t/30_filter_httpd.t failing on outdated versions of
    ActivePerl. Updated the dependencies versions to request the most
    recent ActivePerl LWP modules. Skip the failing test on ActivePerl
    versions before 5.008003. The things I do for a clean CPAN Testers
    bill of health.... 

  2004-05-21 22:37:45 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Loop/Event.pm 1.38

    Ton Hospel discovered that POE::Loop::Event wasn't terminating when a
    single select_read() was turned on and off. This commit moves idle
    detection in Loop::Event's dispatcher forward a little so it's sure
    to run all the time. 

  2004-04-27 01:21:19 by rcaputo; lib/POE.pm 1.174

    Fix the version number so CPAN won't index it. 

  2004-04-27 01:19:29 by rcaputo; mylib/coverage.perl 1.11

    Turn off the debugging. 

  2004-04-26 22:37:14 by rcaputo; mylib/coverage.perl 1.10

    Fix the coverage reporting tool to find the source files in their new
    locations.

  2004-04-26 06:17:30 by rcaputo; t/08_errors.t 1.54

    Removed a workaround for older builds of ActivePerl. 

  2004-04-25 17:50:19 by rcaputo; README 1.106

    Tweak for the impending release. 

  2004-04-25 15:05:36 by rcaputo; mylib/cvs-log.perl 1.7

    Add command line switches, and normalize whitespace so the results
    are more machine friendly. 

  2004-04-25 14:58:34 by rcaputo; lib/POE.pm 1.173

    Increase version number for release candidate. 

  2004-04-25 14:43:48 by rcaputo; samples/README.samples 1.2

    Remove the dead files. 

  2004-04-20 00:52:13 by sungo; mylib/Makefile-5004.pm 1.21

    find the tests in a different (less shell dependent) way so that
    tools like testreport work as expected

  lib/POE/Wheel/ListenAccept.pm 1.29; lib/POE/Wheel/ReadWrite.pm 1.68;
  lib/POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm 1.75

    (!!) complete XyzState to XyzEvent transition. This removes all
    errors and warnings caused by use of the old State parameters in
    Wheels. all tests pass in 5.004_005, 5.005_004, 5.6.2, and 5.8.3 

  2004-04-19 23:29:40 by sungo; t/01_sessions.t 1.30

    mod the test suite so tests pass despite evil nasty garbage
    collection bug in perls older than 5.6. the workarounds are commented
    with nice blocks explaining the problem. the only real solution is to
    get a perl without the bug. sorry folks. there's only so much i can
    do. 

  2004-04-18 22:31:22 by sungo; lib/POE/Session.pm 1.99

    merge in lotr's try_alloc patch. closes rt #6045 

  2004-04-18 19:21:34 by sungo; t/30_filter_httpd.t 1.9

    yet more "older perls" support fixes. only run the tests that require
    qr// on perls that support qr//. tested on 5.004 and 5.8.3

  lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.283; lib/POE/Session.pm 1.98; t/01_sessions.t 1.29

    unfortunately there are really two patches in here. first, remove the
    "no warnings" calls that were breaking poe on perls older than 5.6.
    replace them with $^W invocations as suggested by perllexwarn.
    second, fix the TRACE_FILE magic that was causing older perls to lose
    their mind. the comments here explain this in detail so i wont bother
    explaining it here. its kind of magic but works well. i have tested
    all this on 5.004 and 5.8.3 and all is well there (at least in
    relation to this patch - theres more to come in 5.004 land) 

  2004-04-17 17:20:36 by sungo; lib/POE.pm 1.172; lib/POE/Loop.pm 1.4

    The redo statement is excessively clever. Commented it a little, per

    Philip Gwyn pointed out that the signal() documentation doesn't match
    the full feature set of the method itself. You can send extra
    parameters along with a fake signal, and now the docs reflect that. 

  2004-02-12 07:30:11 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.278

    Applied Scott's patch to speed up call(), which in turn makes wheels
    run something like 20% faster. It's not his ideal patch, but it's a
    good compromise. We're still hashing out details on the mailing list
    of his other patch. I think we're done except for the new function's
    name.

    Jay Strauss pointed out that we're using InputLiteral instead of
    Literal in the I/O filter examples in the docs here. Fix that. 

  2004-02-02 22:37:47 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Component/Client/TCP.pm 1.40

    Bump the version to 0.2802. This will be a CPAN-released update for
    the ill-fated 0.28. I figure, why burn a hundredth version for a
    fixup, especially since we're not entirely sure it's gold?

    The generated META.yml must be touched early in Makefile.PL, or the

    how to tweak the dist targets in Module::Build. 

  2004-01-31 07:07:33 by rcaputo; Build.PL 1.4

    Hopefully this patch fixes all the paths to point to mylib instead of

    remove their lib directories and "cvs update -dP ." to reflect the
    new mylib directory. There will be more files moved around shortly.

    The 5.004-and-earlier dependency checker picks up spurious uses of
    the phrase "use Foo" and treats them like module inclusions. We've
    subtly tweaked the language in some warnings so they avoid the magic
    phrase. 

  2004-01-28 22:46:23 by rcaputo; lib/POE.pm 1.168

  Build.PL 1.2; mylib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.34

    The last commit DID modify META.yml. The new MakeMaker generates a
    Makefile clause that creates META.yml during "make dist". That
    clobbers the more complete Build.PL version we've been using. This
    commit patches lib/Build.PL to find POE.pm in its current location.
    It also patches Makfile-5005.pm so that "make dist" does not generate
    a META.yml. Finally it commits a working META.yml.
    
    In the future, META.yml should come out of cvs, and "make dist"
    should generate a proper one. 

  2004-01-27 19:18:16 by rcaputo; lib/POE.pm 1.167

    Bump POE.pm up to 0.28. META.yml doesn't change, but cvs still
    includes it here. Silly cvs.

  lib/POE/Filter/Block.pm 1.13; t/15_filter_block.t 1.7

    Implement Alexander Zangerl's suggestion that Filter::Block have
    pluggable prepended length codecs. He's writing a C program to
    interface with a POE server, and he doesn't like the C string
    terminator (NUL, chr(0)) in the records. This closes rt.cpan.org
    ticket 3812.

    Renamed POE::Resource::Performance to POE::Resource::Statistics. The
    new form follows the POE::Resource::{plural thingy here} naming
    convention, and it opens the door for gathering statistics that may
    have nothing to do with performance. TRACE_PERFORMANCE has also been
    renamed TRACE_STATISTICS. 

  2004-01-21 06:48:25 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.57

    Apply Gerald Richter's fix to his earlier patch. This corrects
    Winsize behavior when STDIN isn't a TTY. 

  2004-01-21 06:27:46 by sungo; lib/POE/Filter/HTTPD.pm 1.31

    style nit pick. replace some random hard \t indents with the majority
    2 space indents 

  2004-01-21 05:28:15 by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Resource/SIDs.pm 1.9; lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm 1.10

    Minor style changes as a result of adding (then removing) a first
    stab at mark-and-sweep garbage collection for sessions. Turns out
    it's not needed just yet. 

  2004-01-19 22:11:52 by rcaputo; lib/POE.pm 1.166

    I accidentally rewrote the documentation for this module. 

  2004-01-19 21:41:40 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm 1.31

    Hardcode some keystroke character sequences for a few common
    terminals, including the various DEC VT sequences. This should fix
    the input editing and history for most people. 

  2004-01-16 16:58:37 by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Resource/Events.pm 1.9; t/res/filehandles.t 1.6

    Commit Nick Williams' patches to add documentation and fix some of
    the numbers. I also moved the "blocked" checking into
    POE/Resource/Events so we can also calculate the average blocked
    time. 

  2004-01-16 16:44:27 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.276

    Apply Nick Williams' POE::Resource::Performance class and the
    TRACE_PERFORMANCE hooks to enable runtime wallclock statistics. This
    may be extended to include CPU time inside POE::Kernel, within POE
    sessions, etc. It's still raw and experimental code; it does not
    fairly compare performance between different event loops yet. The
    various statistics have not been adequately defined, so we cannot
    verify their accuracy. The profiling code itself contributes to POE's
    overhead and may skew results against POE. Your mileage may vary.
    Small parts may present a choking hazard. Use only as directed. 

  2004-01-15 22:34:04 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Loop/Poll.pm 1.28

    Second attempt to define POLLRDBAND if it wasn't already.

  lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.44; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.274

    Meaningless style tweaks. 

  2004-01-15 22:17:46 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Loop/Poll.pm 1.27

    Define POLLRDBAND if it's not available. This occurs on MacOSX quite
    frequently. 

  2004-01-09 23:11:17 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.273

    Apply Graham Barr's patch to REALLY disable SIGCHLD polling when

  2004-01-05 22:37:36 by rcaputo
  lib/POE/NFA.pm 1.28; lib/POE/Session.pm 1.97

    Wrap postbacks in unblessed, anonymous subs under Tk. Tk blesses its
    callbacks, which conflicts with our blessed postbacks. This works
    around the problem. 

  2004-01-05 22:36:46 by rcaputo; t/08_errors.t 1.51

    Quiet some spurious warnings generated by testing the errors that
    occur when loading mulitple event loops. 

  2004-01-04 06:14:06 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm 1.30

    Matt Cashner pointed out that ^D on an empty line should throw an
    exception. This commit adds the "eot" exception to do just that. 

  2003-12-20 19:40:02 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.272

    While discussing libevent, I realized that a POE::XS::Loop::Libevent
    would not have a trigger module. There would be no IO::Poll-like
    module that causes POE::Kernel to autoload it. So this patch tweaks
    the loop autoloader to honor explicitly loaded event loops and not
    try to load the default select loop. 

  2003-12-18 15:37:00 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Session.pm 1.96

    Applied Alex Avriette's documentation patch. This mentions the return
    values from new() and create(). 

  2003-12-18 04:29:05 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.56

    Applied Gerald Richter's patch to allow setting the child process'
    window size if it's run in a pty. 

  2003-12-16 04:58:46 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.271

    Improve error detection in the POE::XS::Loop loader. Add autoloading
    for POE::XS::Loop::Select. 

  2003-12-16 04:56:49 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Loop/Select.pm 1.54

    Reorder the timeout calculation to reduce latency in select(). 

  2003-12-16 04:55:42 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resources.pm 1.4

    Support auto-loading POE::XS::Resource::Foo if it's available. Fall
    back to POE::Resource::Foo if the XS version isn't available or
    cannot load.

  lib/POE/Resource/Sessions.pm 1.14; t/06_tk.t 1.45

    Event loops. Look for POE::XS::Loop::$something before
    POE::Loop::$something. It should be possible to include arbitrary
    event loops now (Gtk2, for example). Likewise, now people can start
    writing XS versions of event loops.

    Remove the hardcoding for POE::Loop classes. Now POE::Kernel will
    walk %INC and compare each module against the files in ./Loop (where
    "." is wherever POE::Kernel is, according to __FILE__). 

  2003-12-11 18:06:21 by rcaputo; mylib/cvs-log.perl 1.5

    Add a (commented out) option to go back farther in time. What's
    really needed here is some sort of command-line flag. 

  2003-12-04 23:15:19 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Session.pm 1.95

    Applied a POD typo correction from Alex. 

  2003-11-28 17:12:08 by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.268; t/01_sessions.t 1.26

    Replace POSIX errno constants with ones from Errno. The Errno module
    has better errno support than POSIX in "special" environments like
    ActivePerl. This commit addresses rt.cpan.org ticket #4476. 

  2003-11-22 17:45:10 by sungo; lib/POE/Loop/Gtk.pm 1.41

    change init_check to simply not initialize gtk a second+ time. not
    sure why init() is passing the second time but init_check() doesnt
    but whatever. 

  2003-11-22 16:13:07 by rcaputo
  lib/POE/NFA.pm 1.27; lib/POE/Resource/Sessions.pm 1.13

    Move the parent GC tests out of _data_ses_free and into
    _data_ses_stop. Currently the former is only called by the latter
    (and by POE::NFA, which seems to be erroneous anyway since no _parent
    and _child events happen there). 

  2003-11-22 15:32:06 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Loop/Gtk.pm 1.40

    Allow POE::Kernel->run() to be called multiple times in Gtk programs.
    Previously, Gtk->check_init() would return failure when called a
    second time, causing a couple of the tests to fail. This commit fixes
    rt.cpan.org ticket number 4459. 

  2003-11-22 05:05:10 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resource/Extrefs.pm 1.9

    Deferring deletion of %kr_extra_refs items caused inconsistencies in
    the results from _data_extref_count(). I noticed it when
    Client::HTTP's tests stopped exiting on their own. Tracked it back to
    Client::DNS, reproduced it there, and used its test suite to verify
    the error back home in POE::Resource::Extrefs. Whee!
    
    Oh, right. This commit backs out that prior "optimization". 

  2003-11-22 04:55:27 by sungo; t/21_gtk.t 1.20

    remove spurious warn i stupidly left in 

  2003-11-22 04:54:31 by sungo; lib/POE/Loop/Gtk.pm 1.39; t/21_gtk.t 1.19

    add gtk initialization error checking. fix gtk test suite to skip the
    whole suite if gtk initialization fails.

    Ok. So I'm braindead from staring into SOAP modules all day. I
    figured I'd do this one no-brainer just to say I accomplished
    something today. I replaced all the $VERSION strings with Dilithium
    Crystals. Let's see who notices. Bonus: No more retrograde releases,
    at least not after one last CPAN cataclysm. 

  2003-11-21 05:01:27 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.266

    Exploratory commit of the new $VERSION code.

  lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.265; lib/POE/Resource/Sessions.pm 1.11

    Reimplement _stop, mostly by moving the side effects out of
    _dispatch_event and into _data_ses_stop. This further shrinks
    _dispatch_event (some of POE's hottest code) and factors out more of
    the recursion and side effects that made it so difficult to work
    with. 

  2003-11-20 17:13:41 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.264

    Nick Williams at Morgan Stanley reported that the new "Please mail
    the following information to...." message shows up even when _trap()
    is caught from within eval{}. This commit closes his rt.cpan.org

  lib/POE/Wheel/ReadWrite.pm 1.65; lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.54

    Add shutdown_stdin() to POE::Wheel::Run. Refactor some code in
    POE::Wheel::ReadWrite. I have no idea why teh other files are being
    pulled into this commit; they have no changes listed in "cvs diff".

  lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm 1.8; t/res/extrefs.t 1.7

    Move some delete() calls to the finalize stage of resource cleanup.
    Many of the session-keyed structures can linger until the session is
    destroyed. This saves tests in hotter code, which should show up as a
    minor performance boost. Hopefully no leaks are created here.

  MANIFEST 1.91; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.263; t/regress/neyuki-detach.t 1.1

    Neyuki discovered that detach_myself() was not working from _start,
    nor was it working at all. This commit fixes the latter problem, but
    detach_myself() from _start is not completely fixed. Turned the test
    case into a regression test, and started t/regress for these things. 

  2003-11-13 03:11:49 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resource/Sessions.pm 1.10

    Add explanations to some of the _trap() calls, and comment on why we
    don't do garbage collection at what might otherwise be considered a
    good place for it. 

  2003-11-10 23:20:55 by rcaputo
  lib/POE/NFA.pm 1.25; lib/POE/Session.pm 1.92; t/01_sessions.t 1.25

    Applied Dan McCormicks's callback() patch. 

  2003-11-06 20:37:16 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.41

    Applied a patch from Eric (l2kashe) that lets you specify different
    input and output filters for client sessions at the outset. To be
    sure, you may still set different filters on $heap->{client}
    directly, but this avoids the extra step.
    
    Applied Damir Dzeko's patch to support UNIX sockets, but this is
    neither a documented nor permanent patch. A better solution will
    probably be to abstract most of Server::TCP into a base class and
    derive Server::TCP and Server::UNIX from it. 

  2003-11-06 20:34:07 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Component/Client/TCP.pm 1.37

    Re-establish aliases on reconnect. Nick Williams discovered that
    disconnect would clear aliases but reconnect wouldn't restore them. 

  2003-11-04 04:48:33 by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.262; lib/POE/Session.pm 1.91

    Document TRACE_DESTROY, and modify it to use POE::Kernel::_warn() so
    it can be redirected somewhere other than STDERR. 

  2003-11-04 04:43:20 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Session.pm 1.90

    Make TRACE_DESTROY more useful. 

  2003-11-04 02:18:42 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm 1.72

    "rmah" and "czth" reported that Solaris and some BSD variants define
    a SOMAXCONN that is much smaller than what they can really handle.
    Using SOMAXCONN as a hint and clipping the listen queue to it will
    hinder application scalability in some cases. I seem to recall it
    being put there because setting the listen queue too high breaks some
    systems. So it's commented out for now; we'll see who notices.

  lib/POE.pm 1.164; lib/POE/NFA.pm 1.24; lib/POE/Session.pm 1.89

    Propagate the POE::Kernel TRACE and ASSERT constants into any other
    package that is interested in them. This passes environment variables
    down into other packages. 

  2003-11-02 04:51:48 by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.261; lib/POE/Session.pm 1.88

    Generalize POE's environment variable handling so you can specify
    arbitrary POE_foo. These override the constants previously defined.
    It's now possible to define asserts and traces not currently
    supported by POE::Kernel. More importantly, it means you can set
    POE_ASSERT_STATES for POE::Session (and possibly new things yet
    undetermined). Thanks to Nick Williams pointed out that
    POE_ASSERT_STATES wasn't supported. 

  2003-10-29 23:50:58 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Component/Client/TCP.pm 1.36;
  lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.40

    Various Disconnect callbacks weren't actually called when a remote
    end disconnected while the local end had output for it. This was a
    side effect of {Client,Server}::TCP's helpful flush-before-disconect
    code. Unfortunately, the components didn't account for the fact that
    the remote end might not be there. "Apocalypse" discovered this
    condition during load testing and was nice enough to track it down.
    Thanks!
    
    The other two files have whitespace changes. Darn CVS for wanting to
    commit them, but what can y'do? 

  2003-10-29 21:36:06 by rcaputo; lib/POE.pm 1.163

    Increase version to 0.2701, to indicate we're in between-release CVS
    mode. 

  2003-10-20 05:13:52 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.53

    Add another no-END/no-DESTROY method for terminating a child process. 

  2003-10-20 05:13:21 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resource/Events.pm 1.6

    Note a logic error in the cleanup code. The error isn't damaging, but
    it does incur more overhead than necessary during session
    destruction. 

  2003-10-16 15:54:06 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.52

    Bline pointed out that kill(0) sent SIGTERM. Added a defined() to
    support kill(0), and documented the default. 

  2003-10-08 15:27:00 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Loop/Gtk.pm 1.37

    There are no Gnome equivalents for Gtk->main() and Gtk->main_quit(),
    so remove them.

  lib/POE/Resource/SIDs.pm 1.7; lib/POE/Resource/Sessions.pm 1.9

    Add POE::Kernel::_trap for errors internal to POE's core. This is a
    "kernel trap" level of error reporting. Replace many of the _confess
    calls with _trap calls throughout POE's core modules. Wrap many of
    the internal consistency checks in ASSERT_DATA blocks so they are
    only executed during testing. 

  2003-09-16 14:51:18 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resources.pm 1.2

    Increase default block sizes to 65536. This improves performance in
    high-throughput applications at the expense of some memory. 

  2003-09-16 14:48:26 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/ReadWrite.pm 1.64

    Properly set the high watermark state when put() exceeds it. Also
    avoid redundant calls to select_write(). 

  2003-09-15 20:26:52 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Filter/HTTPD.pm 1.29

    Include the tilde (~) as part of the legal character class for HTTP
    header names, per RFC 2616. Thanks to Fabrice Dulaunoy for
    discovering this and especially for suggesting how to fix it. 

  2003-09-15 04:51:37 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.259

    Add a stub for Gtk2 support. Need a way that eliminates POE::Kernel
    hacking for each event loop we want to support. 

  2003-09-10 23:30:40 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.51

    Andrew Chen pointed out that the -9 signal doesn't work. Corrected it
    to 9 in the docs. 

  2003-08-31 02:43:10 by sungo; Build.PL 1.1; MANIFEST 1.90

    Avoid ExtUtil::AutoInstall prompts if STDIN isn't a terminal. Bypass
    the prompts by assuming --default behavior. 

  2003-08-27 01:52:24 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.50

    Dorian suggested moving the setgid code before the setuid code, so
    that changing from root -> not-root won't disallow changing the group
    ID. It made sense, thus this patch. 

  2003-08-27 01:50:48 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm 1.27

    Reformatted a line to be less than 80 columns. 

  2003-08-10 19:48:18 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm 1.47

    Move the size-saving code so that it always moves the current size to
    the last one. This should detect file shrinkage better. 

  2003-08-10 19:14:45 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm 1.46

    Perform a proper fix for the file size shrinkage. Rather than reopen
    the file unconditionally, seek back to the start of it. 

  2003-08-10 18:59:55 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm 1.45

    Azhrarn discovered that Linux only reports file shrinkage (nothing
    else) when a file is reset by `cat > file` and pressing ^D. This
    patch treats only file shrinkage as reset. 

  2003-08-07 20:20:44 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Loop/Select.pm 1.49

    Minor syntax cleanups as a result of trying (and failing) to
    determine the magnitude of arbitrary system clock shifts.

    Silence the "connection reset by peer" errors, which indicate that a
    client has unceremoniously disconnected. To reiterate: These errors
    only occur in the default ClientError callback. Custom callbacks
    still receive notification of the errors and can handle them any way
    they see fit.

    After many requests, I have finally added delay_adjust(). This resets
    a specific timer (as set with delay_set) to be a new number of
    seconds into the future. This is good for watchdogs and timeouts.

    Carl suggested that the TCP client and server not report "error 0"
    (normall disconnection) by default. He's the last in a long line of
    people to do so. "When three people tell you you're sick, lie down."
    The error message is removed in this patch. 

  2003-07-18 22:47:44 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.49

    jdeluise suggested that we document how to scrub a child process'
    shell environment before executing external programs. This patch adds
    that information.

    Apply Leif Gustafson's patch to pass conduit types on to

  lib/POE/Pipe/OneWay.pm 1.12; lib/POE/Pipe/TwoWay.pm 1.15

    Fixed a subtle bug in the new pipe selection code.

  lib/POE/Pipe/OneWay.pm 1.11; lib/POE/Pipe/TwoWay.pm 1.14

    Leif Gustafson discovered a nasty little bug in POE::Pipe::TwoWay
    that was triggered by the recent changes to POE::Wheel::Run... but
    only on cygwin! What a nasty confluence of circumstance. Thank you,
    Leif. This patch should help that a lot, and it finally cleans up the
    really messy RUNNING_IN_HELL stuff in the pipe classes. 

  2003-07-16 06:34:46 by rcaputo; lib/POE.pm 1.161

    Applied Rich Morin's documentation edits.

    Merge in Bruno Boettcher's Gnome.pm as part of Gtk.pm since they're
    very closely related and with a few exceptions identical.

    jdeluise discovered a longstanding bug in cygwin's socketpair and/or
    exec implemenation. This caused POE::Wheel::Run tests to fail on that
    platform. This patch causes the wheel to use pipe, which works,
    instead.

  lib/POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm 1.44; t/14_wheels_ft.t 1.14

    Applied a modified version of jrieks' Seek patch. This lets you seek
    forwards from the start of a file. Negative Seek does the same as
    SeekBack, and negative SeekBack does the same as Seek. It's not
    tested, though: TODO add seek/seekback tests to t/14_wheels_ft.t

    Remove the dependency on $^T and the assumption that it will never
    change. This is only an issue during tracing. 

  2003-07-11 15:39:47 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Loop/Gtk.pm 1.35

    Bruno Boettcher discovered the Gtk event loop didn't work with the
    Gnome abstraction. A quick change fixed that.

    The tests had some timing issues that only show up on the 486. This
    commit makes the tests less timing-sensitive. 

  2003-07-10 04:55:11 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.256

    Correct localized STDERR for Perl 5.8.0. 

  2003-07-10 04:14:58 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.255

    Nick discovered that sessions sometimes aren't garbage collected when
    using call() to invoke their states, and he provided a tidy test case
    to prove it. Thank you, Nick! Once I understood the problem, it was
    easy enough to track it down and solve. Called sessions are GC'd now
    if they aren't the same as the calling sessions. Callers will get GC
    tested if they are the same (because they've been posted to some time
    up the chain).

    Allow internal traces to be shunted to a file without using STDERR.
    This lets applications' (and tests') errors shine through while
    logging POE's internal traces somewhere else. To be sure, the default
    behavior of dumping everything to STDERR still exists. 

  2003-07-09 04:25:09 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Wheel/ReadWrite.pm 1.63

    Avi Finkel noticed a lack of a POE::Wheel::Write, or a write-only
    wheel. He's writing files over NFS, so a non-blocking solution helps
    in his case. I documented the little-known fact that ReadWrite
    doesn't try to read if InputEvent isn't defined. 

  2003-07-08 13:36:59 by rcaputo; t/res/extrefs.t 1.5

    Fix a test which was invalidated by the change in Resource::Extrefs. 

  2003-07-08 00:33:08 by rcaputo; t/06_tk.t 1.43

    So apparently the reason ActiveState hasn't been building
    distributions of POE is because of unreported errors in the install
    process. The latest--and only--problem is a Tk test failure because
    there's a DISPLAY environment variable pointing to an unreachable X
    server. This patch skips Tk testing if the X server is unreachable,
    so--fingers crossed--we should see proper PPDs built out of POE
    starting with 0.27. 

  2003-07-06 18:46:07 by rcaputo
  lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.253; lib/POE/Resource/Extrefs.pm 1.4

    Bruno Boettcher discovered an obscure, yet hideously fatal bug in
    POE's cross-checking code. The code in ASSERT_REFCNT that
    cross-checks a calculated reference count against the stored ones
    does not count references properly, causing a test failure. The test
    itself was broken and is fixed now. 

  2003-07-05 21:04:56 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Resource/Events.pm 1.3;
  lib/POE/Resource/Sessions.pm 1.7; lib/POE/Session.pm 1.86

    Clean up some code structure. Nothing gets fixed. 

  2003-07-05 21:03:56 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.252

    Fixed a documentation typo. 

  2003-07-03 16:34:57 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Filter/Line.pm 1.23

    Clear up some error messages while documenting them. 

  2003-07-03 16:26:50 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Kernel.pm 1.251

    Bruno Boettcher was banging his head on an ASSERT_USAGE message that
    wasn't very helpful. It turns out to have been a bad parameter line
    in _explain_usage(), which is fixed by this patch. 

  2003-06-26 15:33:10 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Loop/Gtk.pm 1.33

    "kaffee" reported warnings in loop_attach_uidestroy(). He suggested
    returning 0 instead of undef from the UIDESTROY callback, which this
    patch does. 

  2003-06-22 05:37:34 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Loop/TkActiveState.pm 1.3

    Remove a bare debugging warn. 

  2003-06-19 20:06:00 by rcaputo; mylib/ExtUtils/AutoInstall.pm 1.4

    Assimilate the latest (0.52) version of ExtUtils::AutoInstall. This
    should fix the "instaldeps" part of POE's installer.

  lib/POE/Loop/TkActiveState.pm 1.2; t/08_errors.t 1.48

    Debugged the initial ActiveState Tk support on a real live Windows
    machine. This commit fixes lots of little things and gets the tests
    working on Windows and UNIX.

  lib/POE/Loop/TkActiveState.pm 1.1; lib/POE/Loop/TkCommon.pm 1.1

    Of course we can't really begin to support ActivePerl+Tk without the
    files themselves. So.

    Support Tk under ActivePerl by polling for socket activity every 1/10
    second. This is ugly. It's inefficient. And it's the only known way
    to make things work at this time. Bleah. 

  2003-06-09 16:02:41 by rcaputo; lib/POE.pm 1.160

    Aw, heck. I forgot to update this to a development version. 

  2003-06-09 15:37:47 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.88

  lib/POE/Loop/Tk.pm 1.40; t/08_errors.t 1.46

    Moved the plain-Perl signal handling code into
    POE::Loop::PerlSignals. This code was common to the Gtk, Poll,
    Select, and Tk event loops. 

  2003-06-05 18:09:40 by rcaputo; lib/POE/Component/Client/TCP.pm 1.32;
  lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.36

    Matt Harrington pointed out that Client:: and Server::TCP did not
    auto-use the filter classes they're given. I noticed that this aspect
    of those components was not documented, so now it's rather clear that
    you must "use" the classes yourself.
