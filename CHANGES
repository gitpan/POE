    Add Paul Webster's test for edge-case YAML input.

    Allow POE::Filter::Reference to not die on bad wire data.

    Paul Webster discovered that YAML from other languages can cause the
    YAML module to die. For robustness, POE::Filter::Reference needs to
    catch and return those errors gracefully. This commit adds thaw()
    exception handling per Paul's specifications.

    Remove test reliance on deterministic _stop order.

    Stephan Jauernick discovered that the order of _stop calls is not
    necessarily deterministic, and it depends on the speed of the machine
    under test. I relaxed the timing requirements of the neyuki_detach
    regression test to account for the variation.

    Very large select() timeouts can trigger EINVAL on Mac OSX.

    Sérgio Bernardino reported that POE::Component::Server::IRC's
    synopsis would go into a busy loop when a client tried to connect. It
    turns out that POE::Loop::Select would fail when the component set a
    timeout for a very long time in the future. Cap select() timeouts to
    an hour to avoid the problem.

    [rt.cpan.org 67680] Use IO::Handle::blocking() rather than
    $fh->blocking().

    Some file handles, such as my $fh = do { no warnings; local *FH };
    can't be used as IO::Handle objects. IO::Handle::blocking($fh) seems
    to work, though.

    This was caught by Troy, who was nice enough to open the bug. Thanks!

    Allow ::Run to discard stdio file descriptors

    - Std{in|out|err}Event no longer required - Stdio file descriptor
    discarded for each stdio

    which lacks a corresponding event (except read) - Added option to not
    open stdin - Added option to redirect stdio to/from other filenames
    or filehandles

    - Corresponding fix needed for test-loops

    Work around a consistent timeout issue in Hinrik's POE::Wheel::Run
    test.

    There is a mysterious 5sec delay when starting processes on some
    Windows machines. The consistent, roundish number of seconds makes me
    suspect something environmental, like an antivirus program, but
    that's just a wild guess.

    Thanks to ultramantis on irc.perl.org #poe or letting me access their
    machine with teamviewer. I couldn't reproduce the problem on my own
    systems, so it was vital to see it failing somewhere.

    Remove Module::Build usage.

    It adds itself to META.yml, but its presence is misleading for POE's
    purposes. POE doesn't need it to be built, configured, or installed.

    Don't block on active child processes at endtime.

    It's important to note that child processes exist, but we don't need
    to wait around for them. Reap the ones that have already exited, and
    alert the user if at least one active process remains after that.
    Return immediately; don't wait for it/them to exit.

    Avoid trying to dispatch SIGDIE to sessions in a POE::Kernel that has
    been made defunct by the stop() method. This resolves at least one
    "please report this stacktrace" bug.

    Allow event handlers to persistently alter $SIG{__DIE__}.

    Prior to this change, modifications to $SIG{__DIE__} in event
    handlers would be lost due to that signal entry being localized. This
    brings up an interesting question: Should the rest of %SIG be
    localized?

    Apply Stephen Oberholtzer's patch to fix a test freeze.

    IO::Handle->blocking() is broken on MSWin32, locking up
    t/10_units/04_drivers/01_sysrw.t in some cases. Stephen provided a
    patch to Perl and to POE to work around the issue. It's portable
    enough that things shouldn't immediately break after Perl is fixed.

    getnameinfo() returns host and port in the opposite order of
    unpack_sockaddr_in(). Swap the return values so the right ones appear
    in ARG1 and ARG2. Thanks to Luiz Eduardo Roncato Cordeiro at CERT
    Brazil for spotting the problem and suggesting the fix. This should

    Localize $SIG{__DIE__} when rethrowing userspace exceptions from a

    Don't fail t/00_info.t if POE::Test::Loops is unavailable.

    This test dependency is intended to be optional, and the loop tests
    should be skipped if the user doesn't want them. Problem reported by
    skbz in irc.perl.org #poe, related to cpanm installing
    POE::Test:Loops in a user-local directory but not looking there when
    installing POE.
