    Nick Perez pointed out that we don't absolutely need HighEvent, since
    put() returns the high-water status much more conveniently. Resolve
    his rt.cpan.org ticket 56432. Oh, and fix an unrelated test plan. 

  2010-07-27 03:10:33 (r2901) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Clarify the refcount_{inc,dec}rement() return values per Olivier
    'dolmen' Mengué's feedback in rt.cpan.org #57314. 

  2010-07-26 16:51:42 (r2900) by rcaputo

    get_next_priority(). 

  2010-07-24 18:35:35 (r2894) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Events.pm M

    Small optimizations. Avoid _data_stat_add() calls when not needed.
    Avoid redundant session refcounts when the source and destination are
    the same. Breaks some pedantic tests, but we can fix those.

    After a lot of hacking/digging Cygwin with a TERM=dumb does not work

    Fix a sig_child() race condition discovered by Tom Lanyon and
    reported (with the help of Jay Hannah) in irc.perl.org #poe. I
    haven't been able to reproduce the problem in a non-MooseX::Workers
    test case, but this change resolves Tom's more complex test case and
    passes tests.

  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm M

    Fix an infinite file rollover when open() succeeds but stat() fails.
    
    Jay Hannah discovered a bug when he passed in a filename with
    trailing whitespace. Two-parameter open() treats trailing whitespace
    as insignificant, so it passed. On the other hand, trailing
    whitespace is significant in stat(), so it always failed, triggering
    an unrelenting stream of file rollover events. Switched to
    three-parameter open(), which considers trailing whitespace as
    significant. Now both open() and stat() agree the file doesn't exist.
    
    Thanks to Jay and the University of Nebraska at Omaha for securing me
    some debugging time on their machines.

    POE::Pipe and its subclasses work best using Cygwin's pipe(), not
    IO::Socket. Previous Cygwin versions work better with sockets. If
    01_sysrw.t hangs for you, upgrade your Cygwin and its Perl.

  2010-02-14 20:18:00 (r2804) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/NFA.pm M

    Some code cleanup in POE::NFA.
    
    Revision 2803 is mistaken. Rob Hildred reported the problem and
    provided the test case that was instrumental in helping me resolve
    it. And the bug report was rt.cpan.org 53517. I mistakenly assumed
    the currently open tab was the same ticket I was debugging. 

  2010-02-14 20:10:56 (r2803) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/NFA.pm M

    Fix state bleed between POE::NFA instances.
    
    Resolve rt.cpan.org 53682 reported by Serguei Trouchelle. Thank you,
    Serguei, for a very useful test case.

  2010-02-14 04:41:28 (r2801) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Applied Andrew Feren's patch to avoid a POE::Wheel::Run memory leak
    when running under Windows. Should resolve rt.cpan.org #50068.

  2010-02-14 02:49:12 (r2798) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm M

    Resolve rt.cpan.org #54319. In polling mode, the wheel wasn't
    iterating get_one() for the entire input from get_one_start(). As a
    result, only one log line was returned per PollInterval. This change
    iterates through get_one() until all lines are returned. Many thanks
    to Oleg A. Mamontov for opening the ticket, and to Bazerka on
    irc.perl.org #poe for supplying the basis for a test case.

    Don't bother propagating wantarray() and tracking return values if

    Display the POE::Test::Loops version, the better to tell when a CPAN
    tester is running mis-matched tests against POE.

    Fix the timing of calling has_forked() from stop(). Also fix the idle
    queue size in child processes so they don't stall if they want to
    rerun POE::Kernel's event loop.

  2009-10-03 20:39:24 (r2714) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Fixed a stop() bug while working on Marius Kjeldahl's test. stop()

    Add in a forgotten semaphore pipe write. fork/exec on sane systems
    wasn't properly notifying the parent they were ready, and there were
    a lot of undefined value warnings. Avoid closing intermediate
    filehandles. Undefine them instead, in case there's close() bleed
    across threads. It's just a hunch, to be honest. I'll know more when
    I try this again on Windows.

    !!! Add mark-and-sweep testing for session stopping.
    
    Reduce the number of session GC tests by only checking affected
    sessions at the end of each timeslice, or related dispatch method.

    Dispatch I/O synchronously rather than enqueuing and dequeuing
    events. This saves a lot of time, but it changes the relative timing
    of I/O dispatch. If it turns out to be significant, then we may have
    to roll it back.

    POE::Kernel->stop(), when called from a child process, must imply
    POE::Kernel->has_forked(). POE::Wheel::Run recommends calling stop()

    this case. Fixes a bug found by Marius Kjeldahl in irc.perl.org #poe.

    Skip the signals pipe when RUNNING_IN_HELL. Child "processes" in
    Windows take out the parent's sockets when they close, causing
    hilarity in the signal pipe code. Probably in a lot of real

    Added experimental code to allow postbacks and callbacks to be
    weakened, explicitly reducing their reference counts. Untested.
    Resolves rt.cpan.org #48670, submitted by Adam Kennedy.

  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Events.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Defer rethrowing exceptions until after run() cleans up. Previously
    exceptions would be thrown farther inside POE's dispatcher,
    preventing some important cleanup. This only affects a few people who
    re-run() POE::Kernel after an exception or using $kernel->stop(). 

  2009-08-08 09:06:17 (r2627) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/Event.pm M

    Quiet Event's exception handler. I'm not entirely sure this is a good
    idea, but it's worth a shot.

    Increase filehandle trace verbosity. Add more diagnostic information
    to Event watchers, in case they fail. Slightly optimize
    POE::Wheel::Run destruction. There's no need to unselect file handles
    in modes that were never watched.

  2009-08-06 10:55:58 (r2621) by gwyn17; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Roll back previous patch. We need to call ->close_slave() on the
    _read handles. Do that instead.

  2009-08-06 07:21:19 (r2620) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Fix case where POE::Wheel::Run CloseEvent doesn't fire on Linux.
    Thanks to Philip Gwyn's investigation and test cases, we found out
    that close() wasn't sufficient to close and destruct slave ptys, so
    the parent processes were keeping them open. Replaced close() with
    $io_pty->close_slave() as needed.

    !!! This change breaks backward compatibility on a relatively unused

    POE::Component::Server::TCP ClientConnected callback.
    
    ClientArgs promised more than it could deliver, and people finally
    noticed. This change backs off supplying the socket in $_[ARG0], and
    it expands ClientArgs' arrayref into @_[ARG0..$#_]. Thanks to Michael
    Fowler for rt.cpan.org #47855 (which this resolves), and POE's

    Some people may be using POE without actually reading the docs.
    Furthermore, they may go on to rant about the side effects in obscure
    places. Recommend reading the documentation in one of POE's most
    "infamous" warnings.

    Apply Philip Gwyn's second patch from rt.cpan.org #47966. This one
    builds upon his earlier patch on the same ticket. It reinitializes
    POE's signal handlers in child processes after has_forked() is
    called. It documents has_forked() and USE_SIGNAL_PIPE. It renames the
    _top methods to _bottom to follow interrupt handler semantics. It
    avoids a race condition by blocking signals for the duration of pipe
    rebuilding.

    Apply Philip Gwyn's patch to deliver signals via pipe rather than

    Comment out garbage collection testing at the end of call(). Neither
    the caller's nor the callee's reference count is affected by the
    call() itself. Anything that does affect the count should be GC
