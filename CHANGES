  2002-13-08 16:56:26 by rcaputo; README 1.100

    Bring it up to date with what's going on. 

  2002-13-08 16:34:52 by rcaputo; POE.pm 1.147

    Bump the version number to 0.23. 

  2002-13-08 15:07:00 by rcaputo; t/29_sockfact6.t 1.6

    Skip a third test which was failing when AF_INET6 was not configured
    in the kernel. 

  2002-13-08 14:59:20 by rcaputo; t/29_sockfact6.t 1.5

    Skip tests rather than fail if AF_INET6 gethostbyname2() works but
    none of the socket calls do. This might indicate that while localhost
    (::1) is resolvable, the interface is not actually configured. It may
    also indicate while the interface is configured, an unconfigured ipv6
    firewall's "deny all" may be blocking it.

  POE/Component/Client/TCP.pm 1.21; POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.28

    A previous change to Server::TCP "optimized" some code by moving the
    ClientDisconnected code to _stop. However, since very little can be
    done from _stop, this prevented post() calls from working there. I
    discovered the problem when one of the POE Cookbook recipes stopped
    exiting as it should. This change moves the ClientDisconnected code
    back out of _stop. It also pretties the default error handlers for
    Client::TCP and Server::TCP. 

  2002-12-08 22:11:05 by rcaputo; POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.38

    Peter Chen discovered and helped solve a problem where the subroutine
    form of Program caused file handles to bleed into the child process.
    The result is that sockets linger open beyond the time they're
    needed-- at least until the child exits. This patch introduces
    CloseOnCall, which emulates close-on-exec as Perl uses it. 

  2002-11-08 19:55:32 by rcaputo
  lib/Makefile-5004.pm 1.12; lib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.25

    Compatibility enhancements for running test reports on Windows
    platforms. 

  2002-09-08 22:05:50 by rcaputo; POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.37

    Apply JamesCOU's doc patch that stops saying things are optional when
    they aren't. 

  2002-09-08 15:05:09 by rcaputo; POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.27

    Publish ClientShutdownOnError, which sets the defalut value of all
    client sessions' $heap->{shutdown_on_error} flags. 

  2002-09-08 00:26:20 by rcaputo; README 1.99

    Remove the link to the deprecated stinky hand-maintained test
    results. The shiny, pretty automated one is much better. Go there, or
    else! 

  2002-06-08 17:08:01 by rcaputo; lib/cvs-log.perl 1.2

    Multi-file commits on slow links are sometimes smeared across several
    timestamps. Previously the report would present them as separate
    commits with identical descriptions. Now it detects and combines
    them. 

  2002-05-08 01:18:47 by rcaputo; POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm 1.21

    Applied James M.'s patch to correct some bad example code in the
    SYNOPSIS. 

  2002-04-08 19:54:03 by rcaputo; t/29_sockfact6.t 1.4

    It is possible to load Socket6 yet still not have IPv6 configured on
    the system. Added a check for IPv6 localhost ("::1") and skip the
    tests if one isn't available.

  lib/Makefile-5004.pm 1.11; lib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.24

    Rebuild the XML test report if Makefile has changed. 

  2002-04-08 15:47:24 by rcaputo
  lib/Makefile-5004.pm 1.10; lib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.23

    Fix paths to cvs-log.perl. 

  2002-04-08 15:45:57 by rcaputo; README 1.98

    Last minute tweaks. 

  2002-04-08 04:40:04 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.75; lib/cvs-log.perl 1.1

    Added cvs-log.perl; added the report upload utility to MANIFEST. 

  2002-04-08 04:39:23 by rcaputo; POE/Filter/HTTPD.pm 1.27

    Fixed an undefined warning in a seldom-used block of code. 

  2002-02-08 16:05:33 by rcaputo; t/03_aliases.t 1.10

    sungo spotted a warning in this test. It turns out that the test was
    printing "ok 15" twice instead of 15 and 16. Fixed. 

  2002-32-07 23:13:22 by sungo; MANIFEST 1.74

    revert last patch. my mistake 

  2002-32-07 23:10:14 by sungo; MANIFEST 1.73

    remove Macro/UseBytes from the manifest 

  2002-32-07 22:54:28 by rcaputo; POE.pm 1.146

    Bump the version to 0.2201 and start a feature freeze. 

  2002-32-07 22:41:03 by sungo; README 1.97

    document the test server and the makefile targets 

  2002-31-07 22:17:41 by rcaputo
  POE/Component/Client/TCP.pm 1.20; POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.26

    Added a heap flag for these components: shutdown_on_error. When
    cleared, it becomes the end developer's responsibility to handle
    errors and shut down connections when they occur. It defaults to
    true, which preserves the old behavior of the components shutting
    connections down. 

  2002-31-07 05:14:38 by rcaputo; samples/filterchange.perl 1.7;
  samples/socketfactory.perl 1.17; samples/tutorial-chat.perl 1.12

    Replaced three sample programs with pointers to their updated
    counterparts on the web. 

  2002-31-07 03:59:58 by rcaputo
  POE/Component/Client/TCP.pm 1.19; t/29_sockfact6.t 1.3

    Added BindAddress and BindPort support, allowing client connections
    to come from specific interfaces on a multi-host system. 

  2002-31-07 03:29:47 by rcaputo; t/29_sockfact6.t 1.2

    Skip all tests if Socket6 is not loadable. 

  2002-30-07 20:43:30 by rcaputo; lib/testreport.pl 1.11

    Add an AUTHOR section. Pedantic, yes, but credit where it's due. 

  2002-30-07 20:42:45 by rcaputo; lib/reportupload.pl 1.2

    Added documentation and a note at the end where submitters can find
    their results. 

  2002-30-07 20:40:19 by rcaputo
  lib/Makefile-5004.pm 1.9; lib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.22

    Replace cvs2cl with a home-made program that creates much nicer
    CHANGES files. 

  2002-30-07 14:48:30 by rcaputo
  POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm 1.60; t/29_sockfact6.t 1.1

    Fixed SocketFactory to support ipv6 host names rather than
    presentation (human readable numeric) addresses. Added the test
    program I forgot when the initial support went in. 

  2002-30-07 05:25:42 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.72;
  POE/Component/Client/TCP.pm 1.18; POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.25;
  POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm 1.59; lib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.21

    Added initial IPv6 support. 

  2002-28-07 04:12:33 by rcaputo; POE/Kernel.pm 1.194; t/03_aliases.t 1.9

    Applied jinzougen's patch to have alias_list return an arbitrary
    alias in scalar context. 

  2002-28-07 02:32:01 by rcaputo; POE/Component/Client/TCP.pm 1.17

    Applied a modified version of Averell's patch to let a Client::TCP
    component connect to a different address and/or port. It first
    disconnects from any established server. This feature is experimental
    pending documentation and tests. 

  2002-27-07 22:25:28 by rcaputo
  POE.pm 1.145; POE/Kernel.pm 1.193; t/11_signals_poe.t 1.22

    Michael Stevens discovered a situation where signals could trigger a
    session's destruction twice. The symptom is a "session does not
    exist" error in Session.pm. This patch adds a simplified version of
    his test case to t/11_signals_poe.t, clarifies the "session does not
    exist" error message, and prevents what is essentially a double-free
    error in POE::Kernel. Other files, such as Session.pm and Select.pm
    were touched during the course of this fix but essentially remain
    unchanged. 

  2002-21-07 19:37:32 by rcaputo; POE/Kernel.pm 1.192;
  POE/Kernel/Event.pm 1.18; t/00_coverage.t 1.15; t/04_selects.t 1.15;
  t/06_tk.t 1.37; t/07_event.t 1.15; t/21_gtk.t 1.15

    L. Leo reported that run() could not be called twice in the same
    program. That was true for a number of reasons revolving around
    signal handling and the need to clean up the Kernel's data structures
    before run() returned. I have made run() re-callable by re-setting
    the signal handlers from within run() and by re-initializing the
    Kernel's data structures too. All tests pass, including L. Leo's test
    case. 

  2002-20-07 03:52:01 by rcaputo; POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm 1.58

    Cristiano Lincoln Mattos reported that SocketFactory was not emitting
    connect errors on Cygwin+Win2k. His debugging pinpointed the section
    in the code where the problem lay, and with his assistance I was able
    to put together a working patch. He also tested the patch on Win2k
    and Linux, while I tested it on FreeBSD. Other tests are forthcoming,
    but I wanted to get the patch into CVS before that.

    make the testreport target smarter. checks for existence of
    poe_report.xml and doesnt rerun the report generator if it exists. 

  2002-19-07 18:17:01 by sungo
  lib/Makefile-5004.pm 1.6; lib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.18

    add make testreport target to, guess what, generate the test report
    :) 

  2002-16-07 19:49:44 by rcaputo; POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm 1.35

    LordVorp discovered that Wheel/FollowTail does not document its
    defaults for Filter and Driver. They are now documented. 

  2002-05-07 19:14:04 by rcaputo; POE/Macro/UseBytes.pm 1.2

    James March found some debugging prints leftover from testing. They
    are removed. 

  2002-05-07 18:58:15 by rcaputo
  POE/Kernel.pm 1.191; POE/Kernel/Poll.pm 1.5; POE/Kernel/Select.pm 1.27

    James March is trying to tweak a POE program for performance. He was
    kind enough to provide some Devel::SmallProf output so I could track
    bottlenecks within POE itself. It turns out that @kr_filenos was a
    very hot data structure, and it was used primarily in ways that made
    more sense as a hash. This commit changes @kr_filenos into
    %kr_filenos. All tests pass. 

  2002-05-07 18:55:40 by rcaputo; POE/Session.pm 1.79

    Invoke inline states with idiomatically correct Perl. This is
    probably just a syntactic tweak. 

  2002-32-06 20:05:24 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.71;
  POE/Driver/SysRW.pm 1.22; POE/Filter/Block.pm 1.11;
  POE/Filter/HTTPD.pm 1.26; POE/Filter/Reference.pm 1.26;
  POE/Kernel.pm 1.190; POE/Macro/UseBytes.pm 1.1;
  POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm 1.20; POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm 1.57

    Sergey Skvortsov reported that Driver::SysRW uses length() to count
    octets in buffers, which is broken in newer versions of Perl that
    support Unicode. In the Unicode sense, length() returns the number of
    CHARACTERS in a buffer, which may be fewer than the number of octets.
    This change adds POE/Macro/UseBytes, which is a backward-compatible
    way of including C<use bytes> in files. It also adds use_bytes
    directives to wherever looks appropriate. 

  2002-32-06 18:50:21 by rcaputo; POE/Kernel.pm 1.189

    "When three people tell you you're sick, lie down." Matt Cashner,
    Artur Bergman, and Todd Caine told me the "POE::Kernel's run() method
    was never called." warning was annoying. I suggested not emitting the
    warning if no sessions were created (so perl -c and some tests don't
    carp). That seemed ok with everyone, so this commit implements that
    change. 

  2002-32-06 18:43:01 by rcaputo; t/26_comp_tcp.t 1.2

    Changes in Client::TCP and server::TCP caused errors in the tests. I
    cleaned up some of the error checking and added some subtests. 

  2002-32-06 18:40:51 by rcaputo
  POE/Component/Client/TCP.pm 1.16; POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.24

    (!!!) Peter Chen is writing a SOAP server that exercises
    Server::TCP's error handling and shutdown semantics. These changes
    apply modified versions of his patches to Server::TCP, and
    corresponding shutdown patches to Client::TCP. Error handling is
    subtly different now; check your code for lingering connections. 

  2002-30-06 22:34:44 by rcaputo
  POE/Component/Client/TCP.pm 1.15; POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.23

    James March noted that Client::TCP and Server::TCP don't mention how
    to send a response on their connected sockets. While omitting such an
    important fact from the docs is a great way to make people read them
    carefully, it's better to include the information. 

  2002-18-06 06:39:21 by rcaputo; POE/Filter/Reference.pm 1.25

    Added tentative (untested) YAML support. It was a trivial extension
    of the Storable and FreezeThaw code. What could possibly go wrong? 

  2002-17-06 17:40:15 by rcaputo; POE/Kernel/Gtk.pm 1.17

    In a tight yield() loop, POE::Kernel::Gtk would fire and reset timers
    so fast that it would pre-empt window painting. The symptom was empty
    Gtk windows. This patch interleaves timer and idle events so that Gtk
    has a chance to catch up with POE. 

  2002-16-06 23:21:27 by rcaputo; t/08_errors.t 1.37

    Standardize skip messages, and use Symbol's delete_package() function
    instead of the hand-rolled function to delete all the symbols in a
    package. This should vastly reduce the number of warnings we need to
    work around. 

  2002-16-06 23:20:11 by rcaputo; t/00_coverage.t 1.14;
  t/01_sessions.t 1.21; t/06_tk.t 1.36; t/07_event.t 1.14;

  t/27_poll.t 1.5; t/28_windows.t 1.3

    Standardize the skip messages. See the style guide at poe.perl.org
    for a list of message formats. 

  2002-10-06 21:15:53 by rcaputo; POE/Kernel.pm 1.188

    Fix a documentation nit pointed out by Randal Schwartz. 

  2002-10-06 21:14:48 by rcaputo
  POE/Kernel/Event.pm 1.17; POE/Kernel/Tk.pm 1.24

    Randal Schwartz discovered a problem in POE::Kernel::Event where it
    would not permit an idle program to shut down. It turned out that an
    optimization in Kernel garbage collection prevented GC from being
    tested if there were events in the queue. Newer SIGCHLD polling keeps
    at least one event in the queue at all times, so GC was never being
    tweaked. It turns out that POE::Kernel::Tk has the same problem.
    These beg the question: How were the tests ever working? Note: It
    might be better to differentiate between Kernel's events and
    Sessions' events, and force GC when Sessions' count reached 0. 

  2002-09-06 23:23:26 by rcaputo; lib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.17

    Some people find the dependency prompts annoying. This change adds a
    note telling these heathens how they can bypass the prompts. 

  2002-09-06 23:10:28 by rcaputo
  POE/Kernel.pm 1.187; t/01_sessions.t 1.20; t/03_aliases.t 1.8

    PerlPanda on dalnet was disturbed that POE exports $poe_kernel into
    main. While that can't be changed right now, this change supports two
    other ways to call run(). Either first call POE::Kernel->new() to get
    a copy of $poe_kernel, or just call POE::Kernel->run() directly. They
    are essentially syntactic sugar to mollify OO purists. 

  2002-09-06 23:04:54 by rcaputo
  POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.36; t/00_coverage.t 1.13

    Tidy up a skip message for the test scoreboard. 

  2002-09-06 13:32:27 by rcaputo; lib/testreport.pl 1.10

    Don't accuse MacOS Classic (and other user-less operating systems) of
    being Windows. That's just uncalled for. 

  2002-09-06 13:31:29 by rcaputo; POE.pm 1.144

    Document that the samples are moving to the POE Cookbook.

    Replaced these files with pointers to their counterparts in the POE
    Cookbook. Eventually these files will be removed altogether, along
    with the directory they rode in on. 

  2002-08-06 19:12:07 by sungo; lib/testreport.pl 1.9

  2002-08-06 03:11:09 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.68

    Added testreport.pl so it will be included in tarballs. 

  2002-08-06 01:01:31 by rcaputo; lib/testreport.pl 1.5

    Make the program runnable from lib/ or /, and make it fetch the tests

    All the mentioned problems in 0.2101 were fixed. Looks like it's
    clean. Bump the version to 0.22 for release. 

  2002-02-06 15:57:43 by rcaputo; t/08_errors.t 1.36

    Cleared up a warning about Filter being deprecated. Thanks to ignatz

  2002-02-06 02:16:31 by rcaputo; POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.35

    Todd Caine requested a "Driver" parameter for Wheel::Run. While I was
    adding one, I realized that STDIN, STDOUT *and* STDERR were all
    sharing a single internal driver instance. That's bad because three
    handles cannot reliably share a single driver (which can only read on
    one handle and write on one handle reliably). This may have uncovered
    a nasty bug in Wheel::Run. Thankfully, 0.22 has not yet been
    released. 

  2002-31-05 21:37:46 by rcaputo; lib/ExtUtils/AutoInstall.pm 1.2

    Updated to ExtUtils::AutoInstall 0.33. 

  2002-31-05 21:14:59 by rcaputo; POE/Driver/SysRW.pm 1.21

    Document why SysRW does not use BlockSize for syswrite(), and fix the
    BlockSize documentation so that it does not apply to syswrite(). 

  2002-31-05 20:24:11 by rcaputo; POE/Kernel/Poll.pm 1.4; t/27_poll.t 1.4

    As I once learned long ago, IO::Foo tends to be slow. In the old
    case, it was IO::Select. Now I've discovered that IO::Poll is slow as
    well. This is the price one pays for using generic modules, however.
    I researched IO::Poll and discovered its internal _poll function,
    which is written in XS. POE::Kernel::Poll was revised to use that
    directly rather than incurring overhead from using the public
    interface. I only hope I can keep up with IO::Poll changes.
    POE::Kernel::Poll should really be better than select() now regarding
    latency and scalability, if only a little bit.

    Matt Sergeant noticed that POE::Wheel::Run sometimes creates defunct
    (zombie) processes. I suspected that it was a race between program
    shutdown and POE::Kernel's reaper. Matt was able to verify this by
    adding some non-blocking reaper code after run() was called. I added
    code to POE::Kernel that keeps it alive as long as there are
    outstanding child processes. This will ensure that they're reaped (no
    more defunct zombies). 

  2002-29-05 02:17:01 by rcaputo; POE.pm 1.141

    Clean up the overview of Filter::Reference after someone (I forget!
    Baud? Kane?) pointed out a typo. Thanks, whoever you are. 

  2002-26-05 07:12:15 by rcaputo; POE/Kernel/Tk.pm 1.23

    Worked around a memory leak in Tk 800.023. Thanks to Zoltan Kandi for
    reporting the leak (usenet message-ID:3D16D3B2.11FC919E@tellabs.com)
    and Slaven Rezic (usenet message-ID:87elevetz9.fsf@vran.herceg.de)
    for the way to avoid it. 

  2002-23-05 06:39:31 by rcaputo; POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.34

    Update the documentation and carps and croaks to guide people away
    from the deprecated Filter parameter. 

  2002-23-05 06:24:52 by rcaputo
  POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.33; t/22_wheel_run.t 1.24

    (!!!) POE::Wheel::Run's Filter parameter was broken as designed. A
    single Filter instance cannot possibly filter three filehandles! The
    fix was to replace Filter with StdioFilter, which only filters STDIN
    and STDOUT. StderrFilter must be specified separately. It's easy to
    write code that is compatible with the old and new interfaces (for a
    module, for example). Just use StdinFilter, StdoutFilter, and
    StderrFilter explicitly.

    Iain Chalmers reported 0.20 test failures under MacOS 9.1. These
    changes address some of the the issues he discovered. They mainly
    fall under the categories of signals, UNIX sockets, socketpair(), and
    fork() incompatibilities between UNIX systems and MacOS pre-X.

  POE/Kernel/Poll.pm 1.3; lib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.16; t/27_poll.t 1.3

    Richard Soderberg pointed out a couple things, which are now fixed.
    First, it's possible to run the IO::Poll tests with an older version
    by saying "no" to installing a newer one. That leads to test failures
    later on. The work-around is to add checks in POE::Kernel::Poll and
    t/27_poll.t for the proper IO::Poll version. Second, he pointed out
    that a few dependencies were missing from the installer. Added!

  POE/Pipe.pm 1.5; POE/Pipe/OneWay.pm 1.10; POE/Pipe/TwoWay.pm 1.12

    Skip socketpair() and pipe() on MacOS pre-X. Even with a vastly
    improved Perl build, these systems seem to have strange problems with
    non-blocking socketpair() and pipe().

  2002-19-05 22:18:37 by rcaputo
  POE/Component/Client/TCP.pm 1.14; POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.22

    (!!!) Change the ClientFilter and Filter parameters in Server::TCP
    and Client::TCP respectively. They were recently "enhanced" to accept
    filter instances, and they would create filter instances from class
    names internally. However, this new "feature" meant that every
    connection SHARED THE SAME FILTER. The changes now let them accept
    class names and optional constructor parameters, and the components
    will instantiate new filters for each connection. "MarkClone" on
    efnet reported that the POE Cookbook web server was only honoring its
    first request; the remainders were bombing out with an error which
    led me to this problem. 

  2002-19-05 22:13:11 by rcaputo; POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm 1.56

    Extend the description of SuccessEvent's INET address field. This is
    in response to Jos Boumans' question about it. 

  2002-19-05 21:59:02 by rcaputo; POE/Filter/HTTPD.pm 1.25

    Prettied up the error dump some more. 

  2002-19-05 21:23:13 by rcaputo; POE/Filter/HTTPD.pm 1.24

    Justify the offsets in error dumps so things line up better. 

  2002-19-05 21:21:24 by rcaputo; POE/Filter/HTTPD.pm 1.23

    When the HTTP parser writes a hex dump, make it use a fixed font so
    things line up. 

  2002-14-05 23:49:32 by rcaputo; POE/Preprocessor.pm 1.30

    Update the instructions for using POE::Processor with PerlApp. Thanks
    to Zoltan Kandi for making sure it works. 

  2002-12-05 17:02:59 by rcaputo; NEEDS 1.7

    Peter Chen noticed that the NEEDS file did not list Storable as one
    of POE::Filter::Reference's dependencies. Now it does. :) 

  2002-11-05 17:53:18 by rcaputo; t/00_coverage.t 1.11

    This test never called POE::Kernel's run() method, so we got a
    warning about that. Now it's all better. 

  2002-11-05 17:47:07 by rcaputo; POE/Kernel.pm 1.185

    feelicks had a problem where his program never ran. It was traced
    back to not calling $poe_kernel->run(). This happens to me ALL THE
    TIME, and feelicks (and I) is sure it happens to a lot of people. I
    added a flag that's set when run() is called. POE::Kernel's DESTROY
    will warn the programmer/operator if that flag is not set. 

  2002-10-05 18:32:12 by rcaputo
  lib/Makefile-5004.pm 1.5; lib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.15

    Fix the cvs2cl invocations so they really include CHANGES files in
    tarballs. The order of operations in "make dist" means that PREOP
    occurs AFTER CHANGES is copied into the tarball tree. D'oh!

  2002-09-05 01:58:31 by rcaputo
  lib/Makefile-5004.pm 1.4; lib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.14

    Have Makefile.PL touch the CHANGES file so that "make dist" will find
    it. Even though we generate CHANGES from the CVS log, WriteMakeFile
    needs to see something there first. 

  2002-08-05 04:17:09 by rcaputo; lib/Makefile-5004.pm 1.3

    Perl 5.004_03 didn't like AUTHOR and ABSTRACT, so I removed them. 

  2002-08-05 04:14:26 by rcaputo; lib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.13

    Perl 5.005_03 didn't like bareword IO::Poll on the left side of the
    => operator. I put quotes around it, and things seem to be generally
    better. 

  2002-08-05 04:13:18 by rcaputo; POE/Kernel/Tk.pm 1.22; t/06_tk.t 1.35

    Philip Gwyn discovered a "modification of a read-only value" error in
    POE::Kernel::Tk's file watcher pause/resume code. I adapted a
    previous plain-Tk testcase to verify the behavior outside POE. It's
    there in Tk on Perl 5.004_05. The testcase doesn't fail with Perl
    5.005_03, so it looks like an incompatibility between Tk and the
    older version of Perl. I've decided to discontinue Tk support in Perl
    versions before 5.005_03. If anyone has a vested interest in the
    older Perls + Tk + POE, I can provide the test case for their
    debugging pleasure. 

  2002-07-05 05:19:59 by rcaputo; t/27_poll.t 1.2

    Philip Gwyn spotted that TestSetup wasn't being used here. That's
    what I get for testing stuff on systems that have everything. 

  2002-04-05 15:34:34 by rcaputo
  lib/Makefile-5004.pm 1.2; lib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.12

    Added the second bit of sungo's Makefile magic. This part generates
    POE's CHANGES automatically from the cvs log. No more twiddling with
    it by hand! Yay! P.S., Everybody better commit decent change
    descriptions, or else. 

  2002-04-05 04:46:04 by rcaputo; lib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.11

    Remove IPC::Run (we're not using it yet).

    Fixed a missing symbol warning when expanded source dumping is off. 

  2002-02-05 22:13:56 by rcaputo; lib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.10

    Disable t/27_poll.t if IO::Poll is not installed. 

  2002-02-05 22:13:17 by rcaputo; t/00_coverage.t 1.10

    Prettified another message pertaining to a missing optional
    dependency. Made an old one more cleare (gods, I hope) about the
    missing module being optional. 

  2002-02-05 22:12:07 by rcaputo; POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm 1.19

    Jos Boumans discovered some segfault-like behavior when using
    POE::Wheel::ReadLine on MSWin32. ActiveState Perl does not gracefully
    handle BEGIN{eval{}}, so the BEGIN{} parts were successfully removed. 

  2002-02-05 22:08:20 by rcaputo; POE/Kernel/Poll.pm 1.2

    Increased the amount of debugging information when TRACE_SELECT is
    enabled. Part of the effort to make IO::Poll work on MSWin32. 

  2002-02-05 22:06:16 by rcaputo; POE/Kernel.pm 1.184

    Fixed the bug Ted Suzman reported on MSWin32 (re: SIGCHLD returning
    positive PIDs). Worked around the fact that IO::Poll is broken (or at
    least behaving inconsistent with its documentation) on MSWin32. 

  2002-02-05 22:04:25 by rcaputo; MANIFEST 1.67; t/28_windows.t 1.1

    Properly attributed Matt Sergeant (not Scott Beck) for IO::Poll
    support. Fixed the bug that Ted Suzman reported in Kernel.pm's
    SIGCHLD handling. True processes return positive PIDs, which were
    being treated as inconsistencies in POE::Kernel. Added a regression
    test for this condition.

  t/08_errors.t 1.34; t/27_poll.t 1.1

    Matt Sergeant contributed POE::Kernel::Poll, an event loop substrate
    based on IO::Poll. IO::Poll is potentially faster than select() in
    large scale servers (and other multi-connection programs). I also
    tweaked a description in the 5005 Makefile so the intent of some
    modules is more clear. Test 27_poll.t is neat, and I'm glad that it
    works. It reruns test 04_selects.t with IO::Poll loaded, forcing
    POE::Kernel::Poll to be used instead of POE::Kernel::Select. 

  2002-31-04 06:29:40 by rcaputo; t/12_signals_ev.t 1.15

    Try to make the skip message so friendly that Windows users don't
    wonder whether they should install Event.pm. 

  2002-30-04 05:27:05 by rcaputo; POE/Preprocessor.pm 1.28

    Added the ability to dump files with expanded macros. This should let
    perlapp and perl2exe "compile" POE programs now. 

  2002-30-04 05:25:53 by rcaputo; POE/Kernel.pm 1.182

    Moved C<use POE::Preprocessor;> to the top of C<package POE::Kernel;>
    so it would see all of the code therein. The "# include" directives
    are incompatible with the new POE::Preprocessor dump feature, so I
    removed them.

  POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm 1.18

    Moved the C<use POE::Preprocessor;> statement to the top of each
    package it was in. This lets the preprocessor (and the resulting
    expanded files) include everything in the package. 

  2002-29-04 22:53:23 by rcaputo; POE/Kernel.pm 1.181

    Applied some of the feedback from Android18, errr, and hdm on #poe.

  2002-29-04 22:49:15 by rcaputo
  POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.32; t/08_errors.t 1.33

    I patched POE::Wheel::Run to use POE::Filter::Line by default. This
    broke a subtest in t/08_errors.t when previously illegal usage became
    okay. Heh! 

  2002-29-04 22:46:06 by rcaputo; POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm 1.34

    My previous "fixes" for FollowTail weren't very good. This set of
    fixes seems to work much better in tests. The problem? Not properly
    detecting when log files were reset. In the process of fixing it,
    more debugging information was added, and the BUGS were updated. 

  2002-29-04 02:01:26 by rcaputo; t/08_errors.t 1.32

    Skipped more Wheel::Run based tests. 

  2002-29-04 02:00:44 by rcaputo; t/04_selects.t 1.14

    The new select bug test failed on Win32 because it assumed select()
    and non-blocking I/O worked on plain files. Fixed it to use a socket
    instead, which Windows can cope with. 

  2002-29-04 01:59:48 by rcaputo
  t/01_sessions.t 1.18; t/22_wheel_run.t 1.23

    Make the Win32 skip messages a little friendlier. 

  2002-28-04 21:53:17 by rcaputo; lib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.8

    Re-revised the module categories. I know it's silly to think there
    ever will be a wording that will satisfy everyone, but still I try.
    :) 

  2002-28-04 21:52:24 by rcaputo; POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm 1.17

    ReadLine now assumes vt100 if a TERM environment variable isn't set.

    Document how easy it is to use YAML with Filter::Reference. Damn,

  2002-28-04 21:48:24 by rcaputo
  POE/Component/Client/TCP.pm 1.13; POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.21

    Standardized the semantics of Filter and ClientFilter. Both may now
    take a POE::Filter class instance or name. For class names, they try
    building a standard (no parameters) instance of the class internally. 

  2002-28-04 21:36:31 by rcaputo; POE/Session.pm 1.77

    Fixed a typo that Kane found in the docs. 

  2002-28-04 02:35:54 by rcaputo; lib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.7

    ttyS on IRC was confused about the "Optional Full-Screen Child

    dense. 

  2002-26-04 19:45:36 by rcaputo
  POE/Kernel.pm 1.180; t/04_selects.t 1.13

    Scott Beck discovered a long-standing (but rarely, if ever heretofore
    tickled) bug in POE::Kernel's _internal_select(). I tracked it down
    to a leftover hash key that wasn't removed when necessary.
    POE::Kernel now deletes it, and t/04_selects.t has a new test. 

  2002-25-04 21:00:20 by rcaputo
  POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.31; t/22_wheel_run.t 1.22

    After spending several days beating my head against the fork/exec
    paradigm on Win32, I have finally concluded that it is not
    consistently implemented from one Windows version to the next, making
    it a veritable nightmare of twisty variations to work around. Neither
    IPC::Open2, IPC::Open3, nor IPC::Run work across the myriad flavors
    of "Win32", and I have neither the time nor inclination to attempt
    success where three such modules-- all dedicated to performing this
    very task, and it alone-- have failed. Arf fthagn poit! (Anyone who
    does have the time or inclination to fix it is welcome to, though.) 

  2002-25-04 20:55:52 by rcaputo; lib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.6

    Increase the required version for ExtUtils::AutoInstall. 

  2002-24-04 12:45:19 by rcaputo
  POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.30; t/22_wheel_run.t 1.21

    Added ARG4 to Wheel::Run's ErrorEvent. This extra parameter indicates
    the child filehandle that generated the error. For example, "read"
    error "0" on "STDOUT" means that the child's STDOUT was closed. I
    also updated the Wheel::Run test to use CloseEvent instead of signals
    to detect when a child was done. 

  2002-23-04 22:38:37 by rcaputo; POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.29

    I added CloseEvent to Wheel::Run. This should address a long-standing
    issue where it was difficult to tell when child processes were done
    sending information. 

  2002-23-04 19:06:10 by rcaputo; POE/Driver/SysRW.pm 1.20

    Remove a spurious $|=1 leftover from testing. 

  2002-23-04 18:48:50 by rcaputo; POE/NFA.pm 1.15; POE/Session.pm 1.76

    Differentiate between package and object methods in an error message. 

  2002-23-04 01:41:04 by rcaputo; POE/Kernel.pm 1.179

    Made some of the TRACE_SELECT warnings a little more descriptive.

  lib/ExtUtils/AutoInstall.pm 1.1; lib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.5

    Moved ExtUtils::AutoInstall to a location where it may be found with
    a simple "use" statement. Also upgraded it to 0.32. 

  2002-22-04 22:58:52 by rcaputo; t/09_wheels_unix.t 1.11

    Make the "Windows don't do dat!" message a little more professional. 

  2002-22-04 22:51:22 by rcaputo; t/06_tk.t 1.34

    I confirmed that Tk's fileevent watchers are broken on Win32. POE's
    Tk I/O tests fail without any reads, and the test is being run under
    Win32, assume that the installed Tk is a broken one. In that case,
    skip the tests rather than fail them. For all other situations
    (including working Tk on Win32), the tests should behave normally. 

  2002-22-04 02:26:01 by rcaputo; POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm 1.33

    While writing a sample program for POE's cookbook, I found that
    POE::Wheel::FollowTail would detect log resets even when none
    happened. I revised the way log file resets are detected, and it
    seems to work much better now. 

  2002-21-04 19:18:01 by rcaputo; POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm 1.16

    Ekkis found a system where POSIX::Termios::getospeed() on STDIN
    returned undef. Default the terminal output speed to 38400 in this
    case. 

  2002-20-04 02:52:15 by rcaputo; lib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.4

     Fixed the filename in the auto-generated CHANGES magic. That's still
    commented out, though. "make dist" will fail if CHANGES isn't there
    already; this is because it's in MANIFEST, and the Makefile won't
    build an incomplete tarball. Added a bit of code to touch the CHANGES
    file so it always exists after "perl Makefile.PL". That's also
    commented out for now. 

  2002-19-04 04:10:02 by rcaputo; lib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.3

    Thanks to sungo, I was able to add magic to automatically generate
    CHANGES from the cvs log. Requires a local copy of cvs2cl.pl. The
    magic is commented out, however. We'll be hand-rolling CHANGES
    through the next release since there's already much custom change doc
    lovin' going on there. 

  2002-19-04 03:59:03 by rcaputo; POE/Driver/SysRW.pm 1.19

    Peter Barabas was going through POE's source and uncovered a logic
    anomaly :) in Driver::SysRW. I made the logic clearer and hopefully
    more correct, and I documented a strangeness between what's expected
    of sysread() and what actually happens. 

  2002-18-04 01:34:19 by sungo; lib/Makefile-5005.pm 1.2

    default the gtk/tk/event tests to not installing all their deps 

  2002-18-04 01:32:48 by sungo; Makefile.PL 1.23

    drop the spurious warn from the makefile 

  2002-16-04 18:21:54 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.22

    Tone down the old-Perl warning. POE hasn't deprecated 5.004 just yet. 

  2002-16-04 17:44:12 by rcaputo; Makefile.PL 1.21

    Change the deprecation warning back to pre-5.005_03. It was at
    pre-5.005_05 for testing.

  POE/Kernel.pm 1.178; POE/Session.pm 1.75; samples/tk.perl 1.8

    Deprecate _signal event, and by association using _default to handle
    signals. 

  2002-11-04 12:14:40 by rcaputo; POE/Kernel.pm 1.177

    Alter ssid macro so it won't expand in a comment. 

  2002-11-04 01:42:35 by rcaputo; POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm 1.20

    Removed use of deprecated SuccessState and FailureState. Made them
    SuccessEvent and FailureEvent instead.

  t/02_alarms.t 1.10; t/03_aliases.t 1.7; t/07_event.t 1.13

    Remove implicit signal handling from the tests. 

  2002-11-04 01:40:26 by rcaputo; lib/deptest.perl 1.19

    Remove mandatory tracing on Solaris since nobody has reported the
    problem it was supposed to help track down for a while.

    Begin the next phase of FooState parameter deprecation in the POE
    wheels. Now any use of FooState causes a carp. 

  2002-11-04 01:36:13 by rcaputo; POE/Kernel.pm 1.176

    Make TRACE_ and ASSERT_FOO output more friendly.

    Add sig_handled() and set things in motion for implicit signal
    handling deprecations.

    Document sig_handled() and finish documenting the changed signal
    handling semantics. 

  2002-13-03 21:06:27 by rcaputo; t/25_detach.t 1.3

    Sessions just happened to be destroyed in the proper order for the
    test to succeed, however, the order depeneded on the position of code
    and memory use patterns. Altering signal dispatch changed the way
    memory was used (and sessions were destroyed), uncovering the
    problem. Revised the test to prevent nondeterministic session
    destruction from causing future problems. 

  2002-13-03 21:04:06 by rcaputo; t/22_wheel_run.t 1.19

    Add debugging information so that signal dispatch could be monitored.
    This is part of the three-phase signal dispatch changes. 

  2002-13-03 21:03:20 by rcaputo; t/08_errors.t 1.30

    Three-phase signal dispatch added new constants to POE::Kernel. Clean
    those constants out of the package between error tests. 

  2002-13-03 21:02:31 by rcaputo; POE/Kernel.pm 1.175

    Implement three-phase signal dispatch.

  2002-27-02 00:20:37 by rcaputo; lib/deptest.perl 1.18

    Add blib and blib/lib to lib/deptest.perl, making it more useful for
    other modules. 

  2002-06-02 00:06:21 by rcaputo; POE/Kernel.pm 1.174

    Tweak the language in a comment. Nothing functional has changed. 

  2002-06-02 00:02:42 by rcaputo; t/22_wheel_run.t 1.18

    A half-hearted attempt at getting the test working on Win32. 

  2002-05-02 23:59:18 by rcaputo; POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm 1.15

    Rocco found and fixed a circular reference that prevented it (and
    thus programs) from exeting cleanly. 

  2002-05-02 23:56:49 by rcaputo; POE/Wheel/Curses.pm 1.10

    Turn blocking back on for STDIN, or some curses libraries won't
    properly refresh the display.

    Updated Windows and MacOS support info. in POE's man page. 

  2002-26-01 21:45:27 by rcaputo; POE/Kernel.pm 1.173

    Wrap binmode() in eval so that it won't die if a tied filehandle
    doesn't support it. Don't call fcntl() on tied filehandles because
    that leads to death also. 

  2002-26-01 06:02:58 by rcaputo
  POE/Kernel.pm 1.172; POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm 1.54

    Wrap binmode() in eval{} because tied filehandle classes may die in
    it or fail to implement it altogether. Both of those conditions will
    cause a fatal runtime error. 

  2002-18-01 19:05:50 by rcaputo; POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm 1.14

    Made ReadLine use a private copy of STDIN and STDOUT so that
    redirecting them won't interfere with the console. 

  2002-18-01 19:03:44 by rcaputo; POE/NFA.pm 1.14

    Add CALLER_FILE and CALLER_LINE parameters. Add a get_runstate()
    method to fetch a machine's HEAP-like substance.

  2001-02-10 05:15:53 by rcaputo; POE/Session.pm 1.70

    Removed some of the mention of synchronous or immediate events from

    Fix a syntax error from my previous commit. Removed most mention of
    synchronous or immediate events from the docs. This stuff needs a
    rewrite in a bad way. 

  2001-32-09 22:58:39 by rcaputo; samples/forkbomb.perl 1.13

    add an ASSERT_DEFAULT for fun 

  2001-32-09 22:57:49 by rcaputo; POE/Kernel.pm 1.154

    Remove enqueued events from filehandle watchers that are being
    removed. In other words, every file I/O event must have a currently
    active corresponding watcher or it doesn't get dispatched. 

  2001-32-09 20:16:30 by rcaputo; t/00_coverage.t 1.7

    add newer wheels 

  2001-32-09 19:36:06 by rcaputo; POE/Wheel/Curses.pm 1.6;
  POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm 1.29; POE/Wheel/ListenAccept.pm 1.23;
  POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm 1.12; POE/Wheel/ReadWrite.pm 1.55;
  POE/Wheel/Run.pm 1.22; POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm 1.51

    Replace $self as the unique identifier in Wheel/*.pm. Instead it's
    the wheel's unique ID from Wheel::allocate_unique_id(). Since I/O
    events are enqueued now, it's possible to delete a wheel before its
    events are all dispatched and create a new one with the exact same
    reference. The new wheel would receive an event for the old one.
    Unique IDs prevent this.
