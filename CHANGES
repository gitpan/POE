    We're 0.34 now. Make some pre-release README tweaks, too.

    Moving a variable inside a scope to save an instruction per event

  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_tail.pm M

    Slow machines weren't seeing all the flushes. Turns out that the
    driver had a chance to glom together put() calls before the next
    writable event came around. Increased the delay between put() calls
    by an order of magnitude to avoid false test failures. 

  2006-04-05 04:22:47 (r1924) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/TkCommon.pm M

    Clear the we're-do-one-looping flag when a UIDESTROY signal is
    dispatched due to closing the main window. Otherwise the after()
    event tied to that window never fires (because the window is closed,
    duh), and an application can hang. 

  2006-04-05 04:21:26 (r1923) by rcaputo

    Explain a test result. Sometimes this test fails. It's not
    deterministic, but at least we'll know more about it the next time.

    Matt Sickler patched POE::Component::Client::TCP and the server to
    use POE::Filter::* clone() methods if you pass an object rather than
    a class name to the Filter* parameters. 

  2006-04-02 12:25:53 (r1921) by adamkennedy; poe/lib/POE/Filter/Map.pm M

    Use the emacs input mode by default. Everybody expects the arrow keys
    to work, and vi power users probably know about .inputrc already.

  2006-04-01 07:37:06 (r1918) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M

    rt.cpan.org squashes indents in source code and patches, and some
    code made it into this module without indents. Fixed that.
    
    More importantly, document the EDITOR=vi gotcha. If you don't have an
    .inputrc, POE::Wheel::ReadLine checks out your EDITOR environment
    variable for clues as to the mode it uses. As a result, many people
    will get vi editing mode without expecting it.

    Chris Fedde discovered that the "harmless" practice of closing STDIN,
    STDOUT, and STDERR before dup'ing them seems to cause a problem on
    Unix-based systems when the parent process doesn't have stdio handles
    of its own. This commit resolves his rt.cpan.org ticket, #16691. 

  2006-03-29 04:22:22 (r1915) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Chris Fedde, in rt.cpan.org ticket #16691, accidentally discovered a
    case where closing STDOUT and STDERR together, then opening them for
    redirection, was breaking STDIN in child processes. This fixes the
    case, but it does not close his original ticket. I'm committing this
    separately so I can check it out in Windows to make sure I didn't
    just break things there.

    Get the regression tester finding and downloading POE component
    tarballs again. CPANPLUS::Backend and ::Config have changed a little
    in the time since I last used this. 

  2006-03-28 05:22:55 (r1912) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Session.pm M

    Upgrade carp() to croak() in the new() constructor. This constructor
    has been deprecated since at least Nov 2004, so I think people have

  2006-03-28 04:31:29 (r1908) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M

    Applied Jeff Pinyan's patch to fix tab completion when the only match
    for a prefix is the full string of the match. Prior to the patch,
    Wheel::ReadLine would just ring the terminal bell and not display any
    matches.

    Try to load POE::XS::Queue::Array before POE::Queue::Array. This
    needs to be made generic somehow.

    broken months (years?) after I reported that ExtUtils::AutoInstall
    needs a configured CPAN.pm. So I give up.
    
    The questionnaire is replaced by a simple list of missing or outdated

    Add the ability to skip certain classes of tests on certain
    platforms, then use it to skip the IO::Poll tests on MSWin32. First,
    IO::Poll is kinda broken on MSWin32 and falls back to select()
    anyway. Second, some of the tests break outright in the IO::Poll
    fallback tests.

    Use the WNOHANG constant rather than the magic 0. Skip child reaping
    on Win32. It seems to cause problems of the "segfault" variety.

  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/comp_tcp_concurrent.pm M

    These tests fail under Win32, so I'm skipping them. It seems that
    Win32 socket creation isn't as concurrent as we'd expect, and
    deadlocks occur.

    Welcome to recursive signals, this test makes sure that the
    sig_handled() flag does not affect outer signals during recursive
    dispatch.
    
    This is currently only occuring when a signal handler causes an
    exception, and the DIE signal is called in response to this. This
    test fails on cvspoe currently, patch forthcoming to fix it. 

  2005-12-09 06:12:44 (r1862) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    This release is different enough to warrant version 0.33 even though

  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    roll exception handling (ala POE::Exceptions) into the core. this
    patch creates a new terminal signal called DIE. if an exception
    occurs, this signal is sent to the session that caused the exception.
    by the nature of signals, if the child fails to handle the excpetion,
    the signal propogates up the session tree until either someone
    handles the signal or the poe environment collapses. two small tweaks
    were necessary outside of _dispatch_event. session_alloc needed to
    cache the value of _data_alias_loggable, for later logging, and it
    needed to check to see if the new session survived _start and _child
    dispatches. currently this new functionality is undocumented and does
    not have its own unit tests. this oversight will be corrected soon.
    right now, all current tests pass without modification on gentoo
    linux running kernel version 2.6.14 and perl 5.8.7.

    MSIE bites early and often. In this case, it's sending "\x0D\x0A"
    after Content-Length octets of POST request, which is clearly in
    violation of w3.org statute number mumble. Here we see the intrepid
    Philip Gwyn patch Filter::HTTPD to ignore whitespace after a full
    request.

    Change signal watchers so they keep sessions alive.
    
    WARNING: This is a major semantics change in POE. It has the
    potential to make code 'hang' in places where it formerly did not.
    
    This change is necessary so sessions expressing an interest in SIG
    CH?LD do not die prematurely. (There is a planned mandatory warning
    for reaped children that were not being watched.) This change fixes
    RT 15215. 

  2005-11-07 06:49:31 (r1851) by hachi; poe/lib/POE/Loop/PerlSignals.pm M

    Disable use of $SIG{CH?LD} = "IGNORE". This cannot be done in perl

    Updated to check for number of sessions in run() and skip the event
    loop if sessions == 0 

  2005-10-22 08:34:44 (r1849) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Resolved a conflict between two event types. The recursive signal
    type shared a value with a statistics gathering event type. Now they
    don't overlap.

    We need to watch for the child process ending in this test so we are
    a good example for the rest of people, and to avoid a mandatory
    warning that may be added in a near-future revision of POE. 

  2005-10-14 17:47:27 (r1847) by rcaputo; poe/MANIFEST.SKIP M

    Toy around with the idea of auto-generating MANIFEST at distribution
    time. I'm not satisfied with the opt-out nature of MANIFEST.SKIP.
    It's too easy to create a temporary file and forget to add it to the
    skip file. Next thing I know, crap's being distributed in the
    tarball. Possibly proprietary crap. I can't have that. 

  2005-10-14 17:26:19 (r1846) by rcaputo; poe/MANIFEST M

    SIGCHLD bug reported by Merijn Broeren on October 13 2005 on the
    mailing list. This test evokes the proper results for me (failure on
    new POE, success on old POE) on Linux 2.6, should be portable but I'm
    not positive. 

  2005-10-05 21:58:46 (r1843) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop.pm M

    "Elly" in IRC suggested that the POE::Loop documentation explicitly
    point out that POE::Loop classes aren't used directly. And that the
    DESCRIPTION point to more detail about how the loops are actually
    used. So here's a fix for that.

    Abhishek Jain discovered a heretofore obscure socket leakage issue in
    POE::Component::Server::TCP. New connection sockets were passed into
    callbacks as closures, preventing them from being closed timely on
    shutdown unless a session also exited. This commit fixes the problem
    by passing new connections through POE::Session's args parameter
    rather than tying them up in closures. 

  2005-08-10 14:44:08 (r1830) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Invoke event handlers in void context if the dispatcher is called in
    void context. Previously handlers would be called in scalar context,
    causing a subtle edge case where objects wouldn't destruct properly.

    Averell pointed out that callbacks via POE::Session->callback() do
    not return their handlers' return values to the caller. This is
    directly contraindicated by the comments. Furthermore, and perhaps
    best, he submitted a small patch to fix it and a proper regression
    test. His report was 100% perfect in all regards (even if his patch
    was a little overzealous). Be like him.

    Apply Merijn Broeren's patch to SocketFactory for ActiveState Perl.
    This improves the non-blocking connect code by not turning
    non-blocking on for ALL sockets created in a process. NBIO is only

    Work around Cygwin quirks in the tests. 1. syswrite() blocks on
    non-blocking pipes, so I moved a test over to internet domain
    sockets. 2. close() on non-blocking sockets writes, so I changed a
    test to use shutdown() instead. 3. Files appear to be opened for
    exclusive access by default, so the Wheel::FollowTail tests can't
    run. This closes rt.cpan.org tickets 11553 and 11053.

    Arturas Slajus (with diacriticals, however) reported a bug in POE's
    signal handling (rt.cpan.org ticket 12953). This turned out to be
    caused by calling sig() outside a running session. This change checks
    that methods requiring to be called from running sessions actually
    are, but it only does so when ASSERT_USAGE is enabled.

    Those are the views that show changes between revisions of a page.
    This was supposed to be the case already, but it turns out there are
    at least two kinds of diff view. I hadn't considered "the other one".
    I discovered the problem while googling for POE::Mud; many old

    Make the POE::Filter::* classes inherit from POE::Filter despite that

    Cleaned up the syntax somewhat in a few of the files.
    
    I removed a huge chunk of redundant code in POE::Filter::Reference by

  2005-05-30 08:32:56 (r1808) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Remove the unused ET_SIGNAL_COMPATIBLE and rename the explicit

  2005-05-30 02:20:34 (r1805) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Put Jonathan Steinert's patch back. Fix recursive signal dispatch to
    use copies of @$etc rather than the original in nested
    _dispatch_event calls. Any future recursive _dispatch_event calls
    will probably need to do the same. 

  2005-05-29 06:13:34 (r1804) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Expose and document the new select() methods' arguments pass-through
    parameters.
    
    Modify Jonathan Steinert's @$etc clearing to preserve $_[ARG0] for
    signal events. Recursive dispatch code really needs that. I suspect
    that SIGCHLD dispatch is still broken, as many of the parameters
    passed down to it will be wiped out before the event is dispatched
    everywhere. 

  2005-05-29 06:10:49 (r1803) by rcaputo

    Fix a miscount in the number of skipped tests under Windows. Also
    skip all tests when using Event, as it seems that Event +

  2005-05-16 20:53:37 (r1794) by hachi; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    The restructured tests cause one of the sessions to receive a SIGCHLD

    Fix SIGCHLD and SIGPIPE so they are IGNOREd by default. In SIGCHLD's
    case, this means Perl will reap child processes so you don't need to
    register a SIGCHLD handler if you don't care. In SIGPIPE's case, it
    means programs won't die if they mistakenly write to a broken pipe.
    Both situations have occurred since POE stopped setting default
    handlers for these signals. 

  2005-05-15 07:07:16 (r1789) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/IO_Poll.pm M

    Use better choices for the poll(2) flags when watching filehandles
    for normal (non-expedited/OOB) input and output. Drop the minimum

    Skip the pty tests when IO::Poll or Event are used on Mac OS X. It
    appears that OS X 10.4 has broken poll(2) when used with pseudo-ttys.

    Moved the POE::Pipe::{One,Two}Way test code out of the

    Fix make distclean so test directories (not just the tests

    Compensate for machines with variable CPU rates. They cause
    hi-resolution time() to bobble backwards by a few milliseconds eveny
    few seconds. This test requires events to run in a certain order, and
    they don't under those circumstances. It may turn out that we need to
    use a timeless priority queue for FIFO events rather than relying on
    the clock to be monotonic.

    Enable support for $kernel->run_one_timeslice() under Tk. I had to
    implement loop_do_timeslice() and replace Tk's MainLoop with a custom
    one in loop_run(). I haven't tested this against the memory leak test
    cases in rt.cpan.org, but I'm hoping this code (which is less twisty)
    will solve those issues as well.

    ActiveState Perl + Tk + POE::Wheel::Run + coderefs = Pain.
    ActiveState Perl emulates fork() with iThreads. Only Perl's core
    exit() will properly "exit" a "process". Tk overrides exit() with its
    own XS magic. This seems to kill off the parent "process". When
    POE::Wheel::Run is used to run subroutines (coderefs) in child
    processes, it must somehow exit() the child process, simulating exec.
    Under Windows, that's Perl's core exit(), which is usurped by Tk,
    which causes ALL MANNER OF EVIL! DON'T GO THERE! WE SURE AREN'T!

    Apply Ed W's advice regarding non-blocking connect() in ActiveState
    Perl. His advice works in stand-alone (non-POE) tests, and the change

    tested whether non-blocking connect() works under POE now.

    Re-entering Tk::MainLoop too many times, plus signals, seems to
    produce a very deterministic coredump, at least on my current FreeBSD
    perl build. Removed one of three instances of POE::Loop->run(), and
    the crashy-dumpy seems to have gone away.

    Replace exit(0) in the test templates with POSIX::_exit(0). Some
    libraries (*cough*Tk*cough*) override Perl's exit(), which seems to
    cause trouble with certain tests' exit values. So even if all the
    tests pass, the FILE fails! Augh! This seems to work around it
    nicely, and it's good mojo on OS X, FreeBSD, and ActivePerl. 

  2005-04-13 15:25:25 (r1767) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Replaced {STDIN,STDOUT,STDERR}_FILENO with checks for fileno() in the
    close-on-exec loop we have hand-rolled. I'm hoping the regular
    close-on-exec works similarly and won't close STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR if
    their descriptors happen to be >2.

    Applied Nick Williams' patch to add Hostname to Server::TCP. This is
    a nonambiguous unpacked hostname or address that will be passed
    through inet_aton(). Useful when your hostnames can be four
    characters long, since they look suspiciously like packed addresses
    to length(). 

  2005-04-13 01:48:23 (r1765) by rcaputo; poe/mylib/PoeBuildInfo.pm M

    Remove Test::More as a dependency. It has a tendency to want lots of
    other modules. That dependency tree eventually leads to installing a
    new version of Perl. Big can of worms.

    Nick Williams and Merijn Broeren at MSDW did the impossible and
    managed to make POE::Wheel::Run pass actual tests on ActivePerl.
    Damn, they're GOOD! This round of patches isn't 100% perfect (there's
    an issue with the Wheel under POE::Loop::Tk), but I'm confident it'll
    be CPAN-worthy shortly.

    Part of ExtUtils::AutoInstall's automated install procedure involves
    calling Makefile.PL multiple times with different parameters. This
    was causing the multiple "wanna run network tests?" questions. Now we

    ExtUtils::AutoInstall.

    Applying Jay Kim's patch from RT ticket 8807. This adds checks to
