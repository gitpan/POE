    Wheels inherit from POE::Wheel. I think someone asked me about this,
    but they didn't open a ticket to remind me.

    Only warn about USE_SIGNAL_PIPE when it's deliberately set on
    MSWin32. Thans to Torsten Raudssus and gcola on irc.perl.org #poe for
    mentioning the problem.

    available at the time the signal pipe is enabled.

  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    POE::Kernel->stop(), when called from a child process, must imply
    POE::Kernel->has_forked(). POE::Wheel::Run recommends calling stop()
    to clear out the parent process' sessions before starting new ones in
    the child process. Users should not also need to call has_forked() in
    this case. Fixes a bug found by Marius Kjeldahl in irc.perl.org #poe.

    [rt 36648] Give POE::Component::Server::TCP a ClientPreConnect
    callback. Give POE::Component::Client::TCP a PreConnect callback.
    These callbacks are invoked just before POE::Wheel::ReadWrite is
    created in their respective components, allowing component users to
    reject connections or enable SSL on the sockets before beginning
    application I/O.

    Defer resetting $SIG{CHLD} and $SIG{CLD} until AFTER the waitpid()
    loop reaps all outstanding children. Resolves a deep recursion issue
    in the CLD/CHLD signal handlers on HP-UX and probably every other
    SysV based OS. Resolves rt.cpan.org 45109 reported by, and graciously
    assisted by, Olivier 'dolmen' Mengué. 

  2009-09-04 02:35:20 (r2666) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Skip the signals pipe when RUNNING_IN_HELL. Child "processes" in
    Windows take out the parent's sockets when they close, causing
    hilarity in the signal pipe code. Probably in a lot of real
    applications, too. Surely there's a better way? 

  2009-09-03 15:30:32 (r2664) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Fix POE::Wheel::Run stalling on MSWin32 when the Program is not
    valid. Resolves rt.cpan.org 49373, reported by Andrew Feren.

    Fixes to POE::Filter::HTTPD: 

    - RFC2616 says a body is implied if we have Content-Encoding or

    Content-Length;

    - C-E w/o C-L is an error for HTTP 1.1;

    - Added copious comments to justify the above;

    - Created ->_reset();

    - If possible, include the request in an error response object;

    - Set ->message on an error response object;

    - Updated documentation. Unit tests for above.

    Added experimental code to allow postbacks and callbacks to be
    weakened, explicitly reducing their reference counts. Untested.
    Resolves rt.cpan.org #48670, submitted by Adam Kennedy.

  2009-08-09 06:37:09 (r2628) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Events.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Defer rethrowing exceptions until after run() cleans up. Previously
    exceptions would be thrown farther inside POE's dispatcher,
    preventing some important cleanup. This only affects a few people who
    re-run() POE::Kernel after an exception or using $kernel->stop(). 

  2009-08-08 09:06:17 (r2627) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/Event.pm M

    Quiet Event's exception handler. I'm not entirely sure this is a good
    idea, but it's worth a shot.

    Increase filehandle trace verbosity. Add more diagnostic information
    to Event watchers, in case they fail. Slightly optimize
    POE::Wheel::Run destruction. There's no need to unselect file handles
    in modes that were never watched.

  2009-08-06 10:55:58 (r2621) by gwyn17; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Roll back previous patch. We need to call ->close_slave() on the
    _read handles. Do that instead.

  2009-08-06 07:21:19 (r2620) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Fix case where POE::Wheel::Run CloseEvent doesn't fire on Linux.
    Thanks to Philip Gwyn's investigation and test cases, we found out
    that close() wasn't sufficient to close and destruct slave ptys, so
    the parent processes were keeping them open. Replaced close() with
    $io_pty->close_slave() as needed.

    !!! This change breaks backward compatibility on a relatively unused

    POE::Component::Server::TCP ClientConnected callback.
    
    ClientArgs promised more than it could deliver, and people finally
    noticed. This change backs off supplying the socket in $_[ARG0], and
    it expands ClientArgs' arrayref into @_[ARG0..$#_]. Thanks to Michael
    Fowler for rt.cpan.org #47855 (which this resolves), and POE's

    Initialize the output masks for sigprocmask. Undefined output masks

    Some people may be using POE without actually reading the docs.
    Furthermore, they may go on to rant about the side effects in obscure

    Apply Philip Gwyn's second patch from rt.cpan.org #47966. This one
    builds upon his earlier patch on the same ticket. It reinitializes
    POE's signal handlers in child processes after has_forked() is
    called. It documents has_forked() and USE_SIGNAL_PIPE. It renames the
    _top methods to _bottom to follow interrupt handler semantics. It
    avoids a race condition by blocking signals for the duration of pipe
    rebuilding.

    Apply Philip Gwyn's patch to deliver signals via pipe rather than
    directly into the queue. This avoids queue re-entrancy during find or

    POD tweak, thanks crab from irc!

  2009-03-10 23:33:23 (r2499) by apocal; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Typo in POD, pointed out by Hinrik - thanks!

  2009-03-07 19:08:57 (r2496) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Another development release. This one relies on the latest
    POE::Test::Loops changes.

  2009-03-07 19:07:45 (r2495) by rcaputo; poe/mylib/PoeBuildInfo.pm M

    We need POE::Test::Loops 1.004 or later now.

  poe/t/90_regression/rt39872-sigchld-stop.t A; poe/MANIFEST M

    Add Philip Gwyn's test for a failure for POE::Kernel to stop if
    lingering processes are around without a sig_child() to reap them. 

  2009-03-02 20:52:40 (r2490) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Filter.pm M

    Gcola discovered that we don't explain POE::Filter get() and
    get_one() return values when there's nothing to return. 

  2009-03-02 20:19:54 (r2489) by bingosnet; poe/lib/POE/Session.pm M

    needed. 

  2009-02-28 18:15:48 (r2473) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Another developer release for 5.6.2 testing.

  2009-02-28 17:36:13 (r2472) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm M

    Add even more fcntl() diagnostic information for a failure the cpan
    testers are seeing on 5.6.2.

  2009-02-27 20:33:51 (r2471) by rcaputo

  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Loop/PerlSignals.pm M;
  poe/MANIFEST M

    Apply Philip Gwyn's testcase and patch for an end-time hang when
    USE_SIGCHLD is enabled, POE::Kernel is idle, but there are one or
    more outstanding child processes waiting to be reaped. The hang was
    caused by clearing $SIG{CHLD}, which would never allow POE::Kernel's
    "we have child processes" flags to be cleared. Resolves rt.cpan.org
    #39872. 

  2009-02-25 07:58:55 (r2466) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    New test release.

  2009-02-25 07:57:54 (r2465) by rcaputo
  poe/t/10_units/01_pod/02_pod_coverage.t M

    Avoid a lot of warnings, which are the inevitable result of loading
    all POE modules, even the ones which are alternate implementations of
    the same methods.

  2009-02-25 07:48:14 (r2464) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm M

    Improve fcntl() error messages to help track down a 5.6.2 failure. 

  2009-02-22 19:48:13 (r2461) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Time for a developer release, to test all the changes that have
    accumulated so far.

  2009-02-22 18:51:40 (r2457) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Try to clarify the _trap() message so that people look above the trap
    for problems within their own programs. 

  2009-02-22 18:44:15 (r2456) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/NFA.pm M

    Reformat some contributed code. 

  2009-02-22 07:45:28 (r2455) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm M

    misset, we will skip the POE::Wheel::ReadLine test rather than fail. 

  2009-02-17 07:28:32 (r2449) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm M

  2009-02-10 06:36:41 (r2424) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Session.pm M

    POE::Session would clear $^W unconditionally, which we consider to be
    bad. Localized $^W=0 to only affect the current block of code. Thanks

  poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Document another chunk of POE::Component::Server::TCP, and deprecate
    Args in favor of ClientArgs. 

  2009-02-03 07:48:59 (r2415) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/Event.pm M

    Skip POE::Wheel::ReadLine tests when using Event on darwin. Event
    fails with an "Event: '?? Event.pm:109' was unexpectedly closed"
    error. Event skips a couple of its own tests in t/io.t for the same
    reason, so this seems to be an Event-on-darwin issue. A better
    workaround (or fix) is welcome. I'm sure Event's owner wouldn't mind
    one also. 

  2009-02-02 07:58:33 (r2414) by rcaputo

    Begin rewriting POE::Component::Server::TCP's documentation. Made a
    couple tweaks to POE::Wheel::Run's as well (since the "Redocument"
