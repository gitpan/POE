  2007-01-03 17:29:46 (r2165) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Bump the version to test sourceforge's new subversion server. 

  2007-01-03 07:14:30 (r2164) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Release the hounds! Or at least the code... 

  2007-01-03 06:13:16 (r2163) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/TkCommon.pm M

    Rob Bloodgood supplied a test for an error when shutting down Tk with
    the window manager's "close window" on a Tk main window. I was able
    to reproduce and resolve the issue, reported as rt.cpan.org ticket
    #21754. 

  2007-01-01 08:38:53 (r2162) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Component/Client/TCP.pm M

    Clear the $heap->{connected} flag on shutdown. Reported by Paul Evans
    in rt.cpan.org ticket 22832. 

  2006-12-31 23:25:59 (r2161) by rcaputo; poe/MANIFEST M

    Add Whitney Jackson's test case to the MANIFEST. D'oh!

  poe/t/90_regression/whjackson-followtail.t A;
  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm M

    Add a test case and apply a patch by Whitney Jackson. FollowTail
    would miss data appended to a log file if the file is rolled before
    the next check. His patch ensures the old file is read to the end
    before the rotation occurs. 

  2006-11-30 01:53:55 (r2159) by immute; poe/lib/POE/Session.pm M

    Finally removed all traces of new() from the POE::Session docs.

  2006-11-16 17:20:49 (r2158) by rcaputo; poe/MANIFEST M

    Fixed a typo.

    Philip Gwyn discovered that sig_child($pid) without a corresponding
    prior sig_child($pid,"event") would drop a session's reference count
    below zero. This commit adds a new accessor to POE::Resource::Signals
    and a check whether the session is watching the PID before attempting
    to clear it. The check will slow down sig_child($pid) calls slightly,
    but they're not actually needed most of the time since POE should
    clear those one-shot events for you. 

  2006-11-14 08:32:08 (r2156) by bingosnet; extras/smoker.perl M

    Updated smoker.perl to use sig_child()

  2006-11-12 07:01:34 (r2155) by teknikill; poe/lib/POE/Filter/HTTPD.pm M

    added get_one interface to HTTPD filter

  poe/t/10_units/03_base/13_assert_data.t M; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Add a nonfatal mode to the resolver explainer function, so that alias
    accessors don't throw errors even with asserts enabled. A big shout
    out to Rob Bloodgood for this one.

  poe/t/30_loops/00_base/wheel_readline.pm M

    Skip Wheel::ReadLine tests when poll() is in play on MacOS X. For
    some reason poll() returns POLLNVAL when multiplexing TTYs. 

  2006-11-03 02:45:24 (r2149) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/IO_Poll.pm M

    The IO::Poll loop would busy loop without reporting errors on handles
    that were closed. 

  2006-11-03 02:44:08 (r2148) by rcaputo; poe/Makefile.PL M

    Improve the prompts for skipping network tests.

    Moved the MSWin32 optional requirements to core requirements.

  poe/lib/POE/Filter/Stackable.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Filter.pm M

    Removed the isa("POE::Filter") check from POE::Filter::Stackable.
    While technically correct, it catches the kind of error that arises
    in early development and isn't all that hard to figure out.
    
    Amended the PUBLIC FILTER METHODS documentation in POE::Filter to
    recommend inheriting some base methods from POE::Filter rather than
    implementing all of them in every subclass.

    Matt Trout strongly suggests that version numbers should have a

    I found this (unused) module in a Pod::Coverage sweep. I'm committing
    it because it looks useful, but it's not part of POE's distribution
    yet.

  poe/tests/10_units/01_pod/02_pod_coverage.t M

    Skip coverage tests for modules that fail to load. They're most
    likely failing because of missing dependencies, and other tests will
    fail if they're actually broken.

  2006-09-23 16:08:30 (r2137) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M

    Remove the sig() reference count. After this commit, registering a
    sig() handler will not be sufficient to keep a session alive. This
    reverses a design decision that was in place for about nine months. A
    subsequent release will reintroduce the feature, but hopefully in a

    Updated Chris Williams' fine POD tests to more explicitly treat
    certain methods as private. Also added a "strict" mode that doesn't
    skip over the methods temporarily considered private while we figure
    out whether they should really be so. Also removed tabs while I was
    in there. Curse you, tabs!
    
    Removed new() methods from classes that are really uninstantiated
    mixins. Calling a nonexistent method is semantically about the same
    as calling a constructor that only exists to croak. Had to remove
    tests for the croaks as well.
    
    Documented select_pause_read() and select_resume_read().
    
    Added leading underscores to a bunch of helper functions and methods
    that should really have been private. There are more to come, but
    their privacy status is less obvious.

    It's only an issue if log files are rotated incorrectly, and in that

  2006-09-05 02:46:27 (r2100) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Curses.pm M

    Comment out the intrflush() call. It flushes to the terminal, which

  2006-09-05 01:41:11 (r2098) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M

    A cheezy hack to avoid destroying Wheel::ReadLine instances from

    this wheel's circular references to $self so that DESTROY is

    POE::Loop::Gtk doesn't perform I/O callbacks in exactly the same
    order as the other event loop bridges. Compensate by increasing the
    expected fetch count here. I'm not sure how we'll be able to
    guarantee I/O callback order, so it isn't at this time. 

  2006-09-02 14:25:09 (r2091) by bingosnet; extras/smoker.perl M

    IO::Poll I/O callbacks were in a slightly different order than
    select() ones, at least on Cygwin. How did I know? Because one of
    Benjamin Smith's tests behaved differently (failed, that is) on
    Cygwin. Anyway, the ordering has been fixed, and the test should pass
    now.

    Resolve rt.cpan.org ticket 20990. XS modules define stub functions
    that throw errors when the underlying C constant is not available.
    Merely checking for defined(\&CONSTANT) is not good enough because it
    will always be true. One must eval { my $x = &CONSTANT } to see
    whether using the constant is legal. That's what the new code does
    here. Thanks to Eric Rybski for pointing out the problem.

    It really seems that Event doesn't catch SIGCHLD, or at least not

    Skip the signals rerun test when using a combination of Event.pm and

  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm M

    Switch from exit() to CORE::exit() for testing under Tk. Have the
    test child program exit one of two ways: "got eof" if it truly has
    exited its while(<STDIN>) loop for EOF reasons, or "got alarm" if the
    child process timed out. Also increased the timeout for slow or
    bogged down machines. Unfortunately the @shutdown_expected test times
    out rather than receives "got eof", so now the test is broken. And
    furthermore, it tries to put() after calling shutdown_stdin() which
    seems wrong. Anyway, this test is still broken. 

  2006-08-28 04:47:23 (r2076) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Session.pm M

    _default no longer needs to worry about its return value if it's

    Tests were failing under Tk because Tk traps exit() and throws a

    Re-instate exception handling from _stop, since we need it or
    otherwise POE::Kernel is left in a corrupt state.
    
    Also make signals (except IDLE and ZOMBIE) properly keep sessions
    alive. Previously they only did it sort of half-heartedly, and there
    were cases where sessions could go away despite handling signals.
    
    The IDLE and ZOMBIE signals don't keep sessions alive. Otherwise

    Yuval Kogman discovered two problems in exception throwing for die()

    Make the MSWin32 non-blocking ioctl() call a little more informative.
    Most WinSock error codes are well beyond the normal $! range, so the

    Relegate some diag()s to DEBUG status, and then turn them off. 

  2006-08-03 16:05:34 (r2017) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/Event.pm M

    Don't park the initial timer callback. Doing so causes Event to throw
    an error when you call POE::Kernel->run() without any sessions. This
    fix removes some noise from the test suite. 

  2006-08-03 15:14:33 (r2016) by rcaputo

    Apply Nick Williams' (Morgan Stanley) patch to restore the currently
    active session and event before throwing an exception via die().
    POE's internal state becomes inconsistent when throwing an exception
    without his patch.

    Applied Nick Williams' patch to remove newlines from history read
    from a file and to truncate the loaded history to the maximum number
    of lines it should maintain. 

  2006-07-24 22:16:22 (r2012) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Remove a discussion of StderrEvent's parameters from the constructor
    argument documentation. Reference the event names documentation from
    the constructor argument section to EVENTS AND PARAMETERS, later in
    the document, where these things are documented in more detail.
    Thanks to Guillermo Roditi for pointing out the problem.

    Peter Farmer pointed out that POE_TRACE_FILENAME was being wrapped in
    silly quotes. This was a leftover when non-numeric constants needed
    quotes because they were defined with string eval(). Now they're not.

    Use POSIX::_exit(0) for the event loop tests when they're run in
    ActiveState Perl. POE::Wheel::Run (perhaps the forking) crashes Perl
    when the wheel_run.t test is run with Tk's event loop. Using POSIX's
    _exit() seems to avoid the problem. 

  2006-06-15 20:05:27 (r1989) by rcaputo; poe/mylib/gen-tests.perl M

    Detabify the test generator. More importantly, turn on autoflush for
    the BEGIN blocks that skip all tests. These skips happen without
    Test::More being invoked, so Test::More's autoflushing is not
    invoked. 

  2006-06-15 15:12:30 (r1988) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Bump the version for release.

    Apply a fix described by Eben Rauhut. He pointed out a place where we

    Apply Matt Sickler's patches to fix POE::Session (and POE::NFA) and
    close rt.cpan.org ticket #14444. 

  2006-04-29 22:38:08 (r1945) by rcaputo

    Make an intermittently failing test's result message more
    informative.

  poe/tests/90_regression/rt14444-arg1.t A; poe/MANIFEST M

    Add a test case for rt14444 based on test code by Matt Sickler.

    #18552: POE::Filter::Stackable does not check it's params
    
    Added some more sanity checks

    #18665: PoCo::Client::TCP sometimes doesn't send Disconnected
    callback
    
    The reasoning is sane, and the code's updated to send it in the
    special case

  2006-04-24 02:42:14 (r1940) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Filter.pm M

    Applied Marco Antonio Manzo's patch to simplify clone().

    ActiveState's build system. 

  2006-04-11 10:06:53 (r1938) by adamkennedy; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Whenever you work with relative time, you have to measure "now"
    absolutely as soon as possible. Moved the time() call from when
    delay_set sets the actual alarm to the very top, which is much closer
    to where the caller meant "now" to mean.

  2006-04-10 23:36:15 (r1937) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Next development version.

    Chris Fedde found a bug in the way Server::TCP creates filters. He
    was kind enough to provide a test case, so I was able to find and fix
    the problem easily. Thank you! 

  2006-04-10 20:37:40 (r1933) by rcaputo; poe/Makefile.PL M

    Fix a bug Rob Bloodgood discovered when installing on 5.5-ish
    systems. The find() subroutines were using next rather than return. 

  2006-04-06 17:58:43 (r1932) by rcaputo; poe/mylib/gen-meta.perl M

    Add the tests directory to the no-index directive. This should stop
    the CPAN indexer's squealing about missing permissions. 

  2006-04-06 16:21:11 (r1931) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Now at version 0.34_01 so that cpan test reports from svn aren't
    confused with the official release. 

=========================
2006-04-06 16:06:00 v0_34
=========================

  2006-04-06 15:14:24 (r1929) by rcaputo; poe/README M; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    We're 0.34 now. Make some pre-release README tweaks, too.

  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm M;
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/k_alarms.pm M

    Increase the timing tolerances on some tests. 

  2006-04-06 03:40:26 (r1927) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_sf_udp.pm M

    Beef up error reporting for a sometimes-failing test. 

  2006-04-05 21:30:12 (r1926) by adamkennedy; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Moving a variable inside a scope to save an instruction per event

  2006-04-05 15:05:45 (r1925) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_tail.pm M

    Slow machines weren't seeing all the flushes. Turns out that the
    driver had a chance to glom together put() calls before the next
    writable event came around. Increased the delay between put() calls
    by an order of magnitude to avoid false test failures. 

  2006-04-05 04:22:47 (r1924) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/TkCommon.pm M

    Clear the we're-do-one-looping flag when a UIDESTROY signal is
    dispatched due to closing the main window. Otherwise the after()
    event tied to that window never fires (because the window is closed,
    duh), and an application can hang. 

  2006-04-05 04:21:26 (r1923) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_tail.pm M

    Explain a test result. Sometimes this test fails. It's not
    deterministic, but at least we'll know more about it the next time.

  poe/lib/POE/Component/Client/TCP.pm M;
  poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Matt Sickler patched POE::Component::Client::TCP and the server to
    use POE::Filter::* clone() methods if you pass an object rather than
    a class name to the Filter* parameters. 

  2006-04-02 12:25:53 (r1921) by adamkennedy; poe/lib/POE/Filter/Map.pm M

    Make the POE::Filter::Map synopsis a little more readable

    Matt Sickler added clone() methods to POE::Filter and its subclasses.
    This addresses a large part of rt.cpan.org #4931. 

  2006-04-02 00:33:21 (r1919) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M

    Use the emacs input mode by default. Everybody expects the arrow keys
    to work, and vi power users probably know about .inputrc already.
    
    Get the delete key doing that backward-character-delete thang. 

  2006-04-01 07:37:06 (r1918) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M

    rt.cpan.org squashes indents in source code and patches, and some
    code made it into this module without indents. Fixed that.
    
    More importantly, document the EDITOR=vi gotcha. If you don't have an
    .inputrc, POE::Wheel::ReadLine checks out your EDITOR environment
    variable for clues as to the mode it uses. As a result, many people
    will get vi editing mode without expecting it. 

  2006-03-29 07:05:40 (r1917) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_tail.pm M

    Change the test timing to work around Virtual PC's inconsistent
    emulated CPU clock. 

  2006-03-29 04:41:20 (r1916) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Chris Fedde discovered that the "harmless" practice of closing STDIN,
    STDOUT, and STDERR before dup'ing them seems to cause a problem on
    Unix-based systems when the parent process doesn't have stdio handles
    of its own. This commit resolves his rt.cpan.org ticket, #16691. 

  2006-03-29 04:22:22 (r1915) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Chris Fedde, in rt.cpan.org ticket #16691, accidentally discovered a
    case where closing STDOUT and STDERR together, then opening them for
    redirection, was breaking STDIN in child processes. This fixes the
    case, but it does not close his original ticket. I'm committing this
    separately so I can check it out in Windows to make sure I didn't
    just break things there. 

  2006-03-28 21:37:31 (r1914) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Loop/TkActiveState.pm M

    Eliminate a memory leak using Tk with ActiveState Perl. Resolves Ake
    Nilson's rt.cpan.org ticket, number 14301. 

  2006-03-28 06:20:53 (r1913) by rcaputo; poe/mylib/cpan-test.perl M

    Get the regression tester finding and downloading POE component
    tarballs again. CPANPLUS::Backend and ::Config have changed a little
    in the time since I last used this. 

  2006-03-28 05:22:55 (r1912) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Session.pm M

    Upgrade carp() to croak() in the new() constructor. This constructor
    has been deprecated since at least Nov 2004, so I think people have
    had fair warning. Resolves rt.cpan.org ticket #8470. 

  2006-03-28 05:15:50 (r1911) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Statistics.pm M

    Applied Lars' patch to avoid division by zero errors in
    POE::Resource::Statistics. Resolves rt.cpan.org ticket #17017. 

  2006-03-28 05:10:47 (r1910) by rcaputo; poe/mylib/gen-meta.perl M

    Add a no_index entry for the mylib directory. 

  2006-03-28 05:10:09 (r1909) by rcaputo; poe/MANIFEST M

    Remove some files that shouldn't be there. 

  2006-03-28 04:31:29 (r1908) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M

    Applied Jeff Pinyan's patch to fix tab completion when the only match
    for a prefix is the full string of the match. Prior to the patch,
    Wheel::ReadLine would just ring the terminal bell and not display any
    matches. 

  2006-03-27 17:41:50 (r1907) by rcaputo; poe/MANIFEST M

    Commit MANIFEST changes. 

  2006-03-23 05:44:47 (r1906) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Make some minor syntactical changes to some comments to support a
    side project. 

  2006-03-21 05:58:24 (r1905) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Try to load POE::XS::Queue::Array before POE::Queue::Array. This
    needs to be made generic somehow. 

  2006-03-21 05:57:34 (r1904) by rcaputo; poe/MANIFEST.SKIP M

    Ignore .svn directories.

    We're not maintaining html docs anymore. search.cpan.org does a good
    enough job that we don't need to.

  poe/mylib/Makefile-5005.pm M; poe/mylib/svn-log.perl A;

    Switch from the cvs changelog tool to the svn one. I'm also testing
    the cia and e-mail notification hooks.

  poe/README M; poe/lib/POE.pm M; poe/mylib/reportupload.pl M;

    Remove mention of our homebrew test report system. It's been down
    quite a long time, and I don't forsee having time to bring it back
    soon. 

  2006-03-15 20:39:13 (r1889) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Queue/Array.pm M

    Whitespace fix... I think. I can't actually see a difference when I
    diff the file. 

  2006-03-11 23:12:40 (r1888) by rcaputo; poe/MANIFEST M

    Remove some more vestiges of POE::Preprocessor. We'll get 'em all
    eventually!

    Remove POE::Preprocessor. Replaced it with a simple, almost one-liner
    preprocessor that's run at Makefile.PL time. 

  2006-02-26 08:37:07 (r1886) by rcaputo; poe/Makefile.PL M

    Clean up the preprocessor's backup files.

  poe/lib/POE/Filter/Reference.pm M; poe/Makefile.PL M;
  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm M

    Replace {% use_bytes %} with a Makefile.PL-time source filter, and
    cross my fingers. If this works out, it'll eliminate the last use of
    POE::Preprocessor, and I'll finally get to spin it off into a
    separate distribution. 

  2006-02-26 07:53:06 (r1884) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Bump up the version and throw in an underscore. Some people like to
    upload CPAN test reports on the cvs version, and it confuses things
    when the results are glommed under the last CPAN release. 

  2006-02-26 05:38:30 (r1883) by rcaputo; poe/mylib/ExtUtils D

    ExtUtils::AutoInstall is no longer needed.

    Remove ExtUtils::AutoInstall from the installer to support
    ActiveState's PPD builder. ActiveState's builder is still trivially
    broken months (years?) after I reported that ExtUtils::AutoInstall
    needs a configured CPAN.pm. So I give up.
    
    The questionnaire is replaced by a simple list of missing or outdated
    dependancies. ExtUtils::MakeMaker will still enforce our few hard
    requirements.

    The end-of-run child process reaper should block if there are
    unreaped processes out there. I mistakenly made the loop
    non-blocking, and now it's fixed.
