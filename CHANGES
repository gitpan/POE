    [rt.cpan.org 87931] Redo _data_ev_adjust in terms of peek_items().

    We can't add to the POE::Queue API without breaking third-party
    extensions. This takes the performance hit to avoid breaking other
    CPAN modules.

    [rt.cpan.org 87928] POE::Queue::Array didn't need
    POE::Resource::Clock?

    Skip POD::Coverage checks for POE::Pipe::OneWay and TwoWay.

    The documentation has been replaced by deprecations. POD coverage is
    moot.

  commit deccbf370f3b2a2d89c5331acf1b4d84d972a61d
  Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
  Date:   Mon Aug 19 03:50:06 2013 -0400
  
    Remove unused code from POE::Resource::Clock.

    A number of functions aren't being used. More are only being used
    privately within the module. Comment out some of the unused ones
    (more dead code checking is needed). Add leading underscores to the
    private ones.

  commit 9c34ae0c06d339c5de81a538f05847bbf61ff5c5
  Author: Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org>
  Date:   Mon Aug 19 03:47:48 2013 -0400
  
    Make a new POE::Queue::Array method private.

    It's currently experimental, and it currently breaks other event
    queue nimplementations, so it has to go. Making it private will
    temporarily reduce temptation to use it, and it helps the POD
    coverage tests pass.

    [rt.cpan.org 87922] Don't crash when ClientPreConnect returns undef.

    ClientPreConnect should be allowed to return an undefined value to
    abort the client connection. Instead, it caused PoCo::Server::TCP to
    crash. This change catches that condition.

    [rt.cpan.org 87721] Clear $! in Driver::SysRW::flush().

    Nothing prevents the user from calling flush() when there is nothing
    to flush. In these cases, $! remained unchanged, which could lead to
    detection of false error conditions. This change clears $! to avoid
    the problem.

    [rt.cpan.org 87635] Fix PoCo::Client::TCP "Connected" event
    w/watermarks.

    If you use watermarks, the Connected Event will not get triggert
    because of a wrong return. This change corrects that.

    Replace POE::Pipe::* guts with IO::Pipely.

    This change doesn't change the way POE or its tests use POE::Pipe::*.
    All tests pass in my development environment, so I expect no obvious
    problems using IO::Pipely.

    Move the signal information out of the signal pipe.

    The signal pipe included all signal information. This reduces the
    number of signals that can be dispatched in a single event loop
    iteration. It also limits the amount and/or type of information we
    can include in the signal.

    This change puts the signal information in a plain Perl list and only
    uses the signal pipe to wake up the event loop to dispatch the
    signals in a safer place.

    Consistently stat file names or handles.

    stat() on Windows reports different device IDs for a file depending
    whether it was stat()ed via name or opened handle. If used
    inconsistently, stat() will always report differences. Discovered by

    Paul Evans for pointing it out.

    Note how to get ClosedEvent when killing processes in Windows.

    Rafael Kitover provided a test case where kill() would prevent
    ClosedEvent from firing on Winodws. We worked out a work-around,
    which he'll be using in MooseX::Workers. I've documented it here for
    others.

    Don't bother with IO::Tty on Cygwin.

    average_drifter on freenode #perl-cats pointed out that IO::Tty fails
    to install on contemporary Cygwin. This change skips that requirement
    when $^O eq 'cygwin'.

    After investigating, I found and reported two problems. These must be
    resolved before undoing this work-around:

    IO::Tty compile failure:

    Don't confess on the use of AF_INET6 or PF_INET6 in SocketFactory.

    SocketFactory uses those constants unconditionally during
    initialization, so things that don't even need them fail.

    Docment that waitpid() calls interfere with sig_child().

    Programs that reap their own child processes AND use sig_child() to
    watch for those processes MUST call sig_child($pid, undef) to clear
    the watchers. sig_child() only notifies programs after some event
    loop reaps the process. If an application reaps it first, POE may
    never know the child went away.
